GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the title of topics that are associated with projects in which the CORDIS reference number is not equal to "100591".
(1) Get the titles of topics that are associated with projects, where the project's cordis_ref is not equal to "100591".
(2) Retrieve the titles of all topics that are associated with projects where the cordis_ref is not equal to "100591".
(3) Get the titles of all topics that are associated with projects, where the CORDIS reference number is not equal to "100591".
(4) Retrieve the titles of topics associated with projects that have a CORDIS reference number different from "100591".
(5) Retrieve the titles of topics that are associated with projects, where the project's cordis_ref is not equal to "100591".
(6) Retrieve the title of all topics associated with projects that have a cordis_ref value other than "100591".
(7) Find the titles of topics that are joined with project topics and have a corresponding project in which the CORDIS reference is not equal to "100591".
