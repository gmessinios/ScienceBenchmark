GPT-3 choices:
(0) "Find the geocode regions from the EU territorial units table where the region code matches that of project members, excluding any regions where the project member's RCN is 3098438."
(1) Retrieve the geocode regions from the EU territorial units table for all project members where their geocode_regions_3 value does not equal "3098438".
(2) Retrieve the geocode regions from the EU territorial units table for all project members where their geocode regions 3 does not equal 3098438.
(3) Retrieve the geocode_regions column from the eu_territorial_units table, where the value in that column is equal to the geocode_regions_3 column in project_members, except for rows where the rcn value is not equal to "3098438".
(4) Show me the geocode regions from the EU Territorial Units table where the geocode regions match those in the Project Members table, excluding any results where the RCN is equal to "3098438".
(5) Retrieve the geocode regions from EU territorial units for project members where their RCN is not equal to 3098438.
(6) Retrieve the geocode_regions of all European Union territorial units that match the geocode_regions_3 values of project members, excluding those with an rcn value of 3098438.
(7) Find the geocode regions from the table "eu_territorial_units" that match with the "geocode_regions_3" column in the table "project_members", excluding those where the value in the column "rcn" is equal to 3098438.
