GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the code of topics associated with projects that have an ec_call value different from "H2020-SC6-CO-CREATION-2016-2".
(1) What is the code for all topics that are associated with projects where the EC call is not "H2020-SC6-CO-CREATION-2016-2"?
(2) Find the topics that have been assigned to projects with an EC call other than "H2020-SC6-CO-CREATION-2016-2".
(3) Get the code of topics that are associated with projects that have an EC call different from "H2020-SC6-CO-CREATION-2016-2".
(4) "Retrieve the topic codes from all topics that have been assigned to projects with an EC call code other than "H2020-SC6-CO-CREATION-2016-2".
(5) Retrieve the topic codes from the "topics" table where the project's EC call is not equal to "H2020-SC6-CO-CREATION-2016-2", by joining the "topics" and "project_topics" tables on matching topic codes and then joining with the "projects" table on matching project IDs.
(6) Get the code of topics that are associated with projects whose EC call is not equal to "H2020-SC6-CO-CREATION-2016-2".
(7) Find the codes of all topics that are related to projects where the EC call is not "H2020-SC6-CO-CREATION-2016-2".
