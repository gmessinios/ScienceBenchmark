GPT-3 choices:
(0) What are the geocode_regions from eu_territorial_units that match the geocode_regions_3 in project_members where the latitude is 51.09717045?
(1) Retrieve the geocode_regions from the eu_territorial_units table where the latitude of project_members is equal to 51.09717045, and join it with the project_members table based on their shared geocode_regions_3 column.
(2) Get the geocode regions from the EU Territorial Units table where the latitude of project members is 51.09717045 and their geocode region is also listed in the project members table.
(3) Find the geocode regions from the EU territorial units table where the latitude of project members is 51.09717045 and join it with the project members table using the geocode_regions_3 column.
(4) Retrieve the geocode regions from the "eu_territorial_units" table where the latitude in the "project_members" table is equal to 51.09717045 and join these two tables based on their matching geocode regions in order to retrieve the corresponding values.
(5) What are the geocode regions from the EU territorial units table that match with the geocode regions_3 from the project members table where the latitude is equal to 51.09717045?
(6) Get the geocode regions from the EU territorial units table for all project members with a latitude of 51.09717045 who are also in the project_members table and have a matching geocode_regions_3 value.
(7) What are the geocode regions in eu_territorial_units that have a latitude value of 51.09717045 for project members in the project_members table?
