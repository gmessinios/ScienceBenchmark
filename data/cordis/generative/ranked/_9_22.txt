Original Query:
SELECT T1.title FROM funding_schemes AS T1 JOIN projects AS T2 ON T1.code = T2.ec_fund_scheme WHERE T2.framework_program != "FP7"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) "Retrieve the title of all funding schemes from projects where the framework program is not equal to 'FP7' and matches the code in the funding schemes table."
(1) Retrieve the title of funding schemes from the table "funding_schemes" for projects that have a framework program other than "FP7" by joining the two tables on the code and ec_fund_scheme columns.
(2) Find the titles of all funding schemes for projects that are not under the FP7 framework program.
(3) What are the titles of all funding schemes for projects that have an EC fund scheme code and were not part of the FP7 framework program?
(4) Find the title of funding schemes for projects that have a framework program other than FP7.
(5) Get the titles of all funding schemes from the funding_schemes table where the code matches with the ec_fund_scheme column in projects table and filter out those projects that are not part of FP7 framework program.
(6) "Retrieve the title of all funding schemes where the code matches the EC fund scheme used in projects, excluding those from FP7."
(7) Retrieve the title of all funding schemes from the table "funding_schemes" for projects that have a European Commission fund scheme code, except for those under framework program FP7.
