Original Query:
SELECT T1.code FROM funding_schemes AS T1 JOIN projects AS T2 ON T1.code = T2.ec_fund_scheme WHERE T2.principal_investigator != 1210532
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the funding scheme code from the funding schemes table for all projects where the principal investigator is not equal to 1210532.
(1) Get the codes of all funding schemes from the funding_schemes table that correspond to projects in the projects table where the principal investigator is not 1210532.
(2) Retrieve the code of the funding scheme from the table "funding_schemes" for projects where the principal investigator is not equal to 1210532, and join it with the "projects" table on matching codes.
(3) Find the funding scheme code from the table "funding_schemes" where the principal investigator is not 1210532 in the "projects" table.
(4) Retrieve the code from the funding_schemes table for all projects that have a principal investigator who is not 1210532.
(5) Find the code of funding schemes where the principal investigator is not 1210532 for projects that have been joined with funding schemes.
(6) Retrieve the code of all funding schemes where the principal investigator is not 1210532 from projects.
(7) Retrieve the code of all funding schemes for projects where the principal investigator is not equal to 1210532.
