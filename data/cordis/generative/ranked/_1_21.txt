GPT-3 choices:
(0) Get the code for the research domain from erc_research_domains that is related to a panel in erc_panels which is associated with a project in project_erc_panels that has an unics_id of 144391.
(1) Retrieve the code of ERC research domains that are part of a panel, which is assigned to a project with an UNICS ID of 144391.
(2) Get the code for the research domain from erc_research_domains where it is a part of a panel in erc_panels, which is then linked to a project in project_erc_panels and finally matched with a specific project using its UNICS ID.
(3) Find the research domain code for ERC research domains that are part of ERC panels which are included in projects with a UNICS ID of 144391.
(4) Retrieve the code for the research domain from the ERC research domains table where the code matches a panel in the ERC panels table which is part of a project in the project ERC panels table and that project has a unique ID of 144391 in the projects table.
(5) What are the research domains that are associated with the ERC panels that are part of the project ERC Research Panels and have a code equal to 144391?
(6) Retrieve the code for the research domain from erc_research_domains that is associated with a panel from erc_panels that is part of a project in project_erc_panels that has an unics_id of 144391 in projects.
(7) What are the research domains that are part of the panels that belong to a project with UNICS ID 144391?
