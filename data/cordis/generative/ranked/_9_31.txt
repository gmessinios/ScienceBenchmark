Original Query:
SELECT T1.postal_code FROM project_members AS T1 JOIN eu_territorial_units AS T2 ON T1.geocode_regions_3 = T2.geocode_regions WHERE T2.nuts_version != "2021"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the postal code from project members where the geocode region in the project members table is equal to the geocode region in the EU territorial units table, but only for regions with a NUTS version that is not equal to "2021".
(1) Find the postal code of project members in regions that do not match the 2021 version of EU territorial units.
(2) Find the postal codes for all project members whose geocode regions do not match the NUTS version 2021 in the European Union territorial units.
(3) Get the postal code of project members who are located in European territorial units that have a NUTS version other than 2021.
(4) Get the postal codes of project members who are located in European Union territorial units with a NUTS version that is not equal to "2021".
(5) Retrieve the postal code from project members where the third geocode region matches a geocode region in EU territorial units with a nuts version other than "2021".
(6) Retrieve the postal code from the project_members table for all project members whose geocode_regions_3 value matches a geocode_regions value in the eu_territorial_units table where the nuts_version is not equal to "2021".
(7) Retrieve the postal codes of project members who are located in EU territorial units that have a NUTS version different from "2021".
