GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the name of the framework program from the EC Framework Programs table where the UNICS ID in the Projects table is not equal to 144571.
(1) Find the names of all framework programs from the table "ec_framework_programs" that are listed as a project's framework program in the table "projects", excluding those with a unics_id of 144571.
(2) Retrieve the names of all framework programs from the EC Framework Programs table that are associated with projects, but exclude the project with a UNICS ID of 144571.
(3) Find the names of all EC Framework Programs that are associated with projects other than the one with a UNICS ID of 144571.
(4) What are the names of framework programs for projects where the UNICS ID is not equal to 144571?
(5) Find the name of each framework program that is listed in both the "ec_framework_programs" and "projects" tables, except for those associated with the project having an unics_id of 144571.
(6) Find the names of all framework programs from the ec_framework_programs table that have been used in projects, except for the one with a UNICS ID of 144571.
(7) Find the name of the framework program from the "ec_framework_programs" table where its name matches a value in the "framework_program" column in the "projects" table, excluding any results where the unics_id is equal to 144571.
