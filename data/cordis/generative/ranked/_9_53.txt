Original Query:
SELECT T1.geocode_country_code FROM countries AS T1 JOIN institutions AS T2 ON T1.unics_id = T2.country_id WHERE T2.geocode_regions_3 != "FR101"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the geocode country code for all countries that have a matching unics_id in the countries table and whose corresponding institutions have a geocode_regions_3 value not equal to "FR101".
(1) Get the geocode country code for all countries from the institutions table where the geocode regions 3 column is not equal to "FR101" and join it with the countries table using the unique ID from both tables.
(2) What are the geocode country codes for countries where the unics ID of institutions matches with the country ID and the geocode regions 3 is not equal to "FR101"?
(3) Get the geocode country code for all countries from the institutions table, joining with the countries table where the unics_id matches with the country_id and excluding any rows where geocode_regions_3 is equal to "FR101".
(4) Find the geocode country code for countries that have a matching unics ID in the institutions table, where the geocode regions 3 is not equal to "FR101".
(5) "Retrieve the geocode country code for countries that have a matching unics ID in the institutions table, excluding any records where the institution's geocode region 3 is not equal to "FR101"."
(6) Get the geocode country code for all countries that have an institution with a geocode region 3 other than "FR101".
(7) Retrieve the geocode country code from the countries table for all institutions whose geocode regions 3 is not equal to "FR101" by joining the countries and institutions tables using their corresponding IDs.
