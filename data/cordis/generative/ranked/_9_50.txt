Original Query:
SELECT T1.country_code3 FROM countries AS T1 JOIN institutions AS T2 ON T1.unics_id = T2.country_id WHERE T2.grid_id != "grid.29869.3c"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the country code3 for all countries that have an institution with a grid_id other than "grid.29869.3c".
(1) Retrieve the country code3 from the countries table where the unics_id in countries is equal to the country_id in institutions and the grid_id in institutions is not equal to "grid.29869.3c".
(2) Retrieve the country code3 from the countries table for all institutions that have a country ID matching the UNICS ID in countries and whose grid ID is not equal to "grid.29869.3c".
(3) What are the three-letter country codes for countries that have institutions with a grid ID other than "grid.29869.3c"?
(4) Retrieve the country code 3 for all countries that are associated with institutions that have a grid ID different from "grid.29869.3c".
(5) Retrieve the three-letter country code for countries where institutions are located, as long as the institution's grid ID is not equal to "grid.29869.3c".
(6) Find the country code3 for all countries that have a unics_id in the countries table and are associated with an institution that has a grid_id not equal to "grid.29869.3c" in the institutions table.
(7) Find the country code3 for all countries that have a matching unics_id in the countries table and also have a grid_id that is not equal to "grid.29869.3c" in the institutions table.
