Original Query:
SELECT T1.unics_id FROM projects AS T1 JOIN ec_framework_programs AS T2 ON T1.framework_program = T2.ec_framework_program_name WHERE T2.ec_framework_program_name != "FP4"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Return the unique project identifiers from all projects that have a framework program other than "FP4", by joining the "projects" and "ec_framework_programs" tables and filtering for projects whose framework program matches an entry in the "ec_framework_programs" table.
(1) Retrieve the unique project identifiers from the projects table for all projects that are associated with a framework program listed in the ec_framework_programs table, excluding any projects that are associated with the framework program "FP4".
(2) Find the unique ID of all projects that are not part of the FP4 framework program.
(3) Find the unique identifier of all projects where the framework program is not equal to "FP4" by joining the projects table with the ec_framework_programs table and selecting the unics_id from projects.
(4) Get the UNICS ID for all projects that have a framework program other than "FP4".
(5) Get the unique ID of all projects that have a framework program that is not "FP4" by joining the "projects" table with the "ec_framework_programs" table on their respective framework program names.
(6) Find the unique identifier of all projects that are not part of the framework program named "FP4".
(7) Retrieve the unique identification numbers of projects that are associated with any framework program except for "FP4".
