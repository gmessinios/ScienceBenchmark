Original Query:
SELECT T1.city FROM project_members AS T1 JOIN eu_territorial_units AS T2 ON T1.geocode_regions_3 = T2.geocode_regions WHERE T2.description != "Mid-West"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Select the cities of project members from the EU territorial units, excluding those in the "Mid-West" region.
(1) Retrieve the city of all project members whose geocode_regions_3 does not match with the description "Mid-West" in the eu_territorial_units table.
(2) Find the city of each member from a project where their geographical code region 3 does not match the description "Mid-West" in the EU territorial units table.
(3) Retrieve the city names from the project members table where the geocode_regions_3 column in the project_members table matches with the geocode_regions column in the eu_territorial_units table, but only for rows where the description in eu_territorial_units is not equal to "Mid-West".
(4) Find the city names from project members where the region code in eu_territorial_units is not "Mid-West".
(5) Retrieve the cities of all project members who are located in regions that are not classified as "Mid-West".
(6) Select the cities from the table of project members where the geocode regions match between project members and EU territorial units, but only for those EU territorial units that are not labeled as "Mid-West."
(7) Find the city of all members who are part of projects in territories that are not classified as "Mid-West" according to the European Territorial Units database.
