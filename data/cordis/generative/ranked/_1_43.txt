GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the subject area codes from projects that have a principal investigator with an unics_id of 1217094 by joining the subject_areas and project_subject_areas tables on their corresponding columns, and then joining that result with the projects table on the project_subject_areas.project column.
(1) Show the subject area codes for all projects that have a principal investigator with the UNICS ID 1217094.
(2) Find the subject area code from the subject areas table where the principal investigator is 1217094 and is associated with a project in the project_subject_areas table which also has a match in the projects table.
(3) What are the subject areas associated with projects where the principal investigator is 1217094?
(4) Retrieve the subject area codes for all projects in which the principal investigator has a UNICS ID of 1217094.
(5) Find the code for subject areas that are associated with a project in which the principal investigator has a unics_id of 1217094.
(6) Find the subject area codes for all projects in which user 1217094 is listed as the principal investigator.
(7) Get the subject areas code from the subject_areas table where the principal investigator is 1217094 in projects table and join with project_subject_areas table on subject area code.
