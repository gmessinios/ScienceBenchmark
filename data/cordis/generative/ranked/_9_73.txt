###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.code FROM funding_schemes AS T1 JOIN projects AS T2 ON T1.code = T2.ec_fund_scheme WHERE T2.acronym != "nanoCARBS"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Get the code for funding schemes from projects where the acronym is not "nanoCARBS".
(1) Find the codes of all funding schemes that are associated with projects whose acronym is not "nanoCARBS".
(2) Retrieve the code of the funding schemes for all projects except "nanoCARBS" by joining the tables "funding_schemes" and "projects" on their matching column "code".
(3) Find the codes for all funding schemes that are associated with projects whose acronym is not "nanoCARBS".
(4) Get the codes for funding schemes from the table "funding_schemes" where the code matches with the column "ec_fund_scheme" in the table "projects" excluding any projects with an acronym of "nanoCARBS".
(5) Retrieve the code of all funding schemes for projects where the acronym is not "nanoCARBS".
(6) Retrieve the code from the funding schemes table for all projects that are not associated with the "nanoCARBS" acronym.
(7) Retrieve the code of all funding schemes from the funding_schemes table where the acronym of the associated project in projects table is not equal to "nanoCARBS".
