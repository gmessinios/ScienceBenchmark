Original Query:
SELECT T1.rcn FROM project_members AS T1 JOIN eu_territorial_units AS T2 ON T1.geocode_regions_3 = T2.geocode_regions WHERE T2.nuts_version = "2021"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) What are the RCN numbers of project members who belong to European territorial units with NUTS version 2021?
(1) Retrieve the RCN values of project members whose geocode_regions_3 match with the geocode_regions of EU territorial units for which the nuts_version is "2021".
(2) Get the RCN values from project_members for all rows where the geocode_regions_3 column equals the geocode_regions column in eu_territorial_units with a nuts_version of 2021.
(3) "Find the RCN of all project members who are located in EU territorial units that have a NUTS version of 2021."
(4) Get the RCN from project members where the geocode regions of project members matches the geocode regions of EU territorial units with a NUTS version of 2021.
(5) Find the RCN of project members who are located in regions with a NUTS version of 2021 by joining the project_members and eu_territorial_units tables and filtering for matching geocode_regions_3 values.
(6) Retrieve the RCN of project members from the table project_members, where their geocode_regions_3 value is equal to the geocode_regions in the eu_territorial_units table with a NUTS version of "2021".
(7) Retrieve the RCN value from the project_members table for all members who have a geocode_regions_3 value that corresponds to a 2021 NUTS version code in the eu_territorial_units table.
