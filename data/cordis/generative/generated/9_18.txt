Original Query:
SELECT T1.code FROM funding_schemes AS T1 JOIN projects AS T2 ON T1.code = T2.ec_fund_scheme WHERE T2.unics_id != 144075
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the codes for all funding schemes that are associated with projects in which the UNICS ID is not 144075.
(1) Retrieve the code of the funding scheme for projects that have a UNICS ID different from 144075.
(2) Retrieve the code of all funding schemes from the table "funding_schemes" where the project's EC fund scheme is not equal to "144075".
(3) Get the code for all funding schemes that are used by projects with a UNICS ID different from 144075.
(4) Find the code for all funding schemes associated with projects that are not identified by UNICS ID 144075.
(5) Find the codes for funding schemes from projects where the UNICS ID is not equal to 144075.
(6) Retrieve the funding scheme code from the "funding_schemes" table for all projects, except for project with unics_id 144075, that have a matching code in both the "funding_schemes" and "projects" tables.
(7) Find the codes of all funding schemes from the funding_schemes table that are linked to projects in the projects table where the unics_id is not equal to 144075.
