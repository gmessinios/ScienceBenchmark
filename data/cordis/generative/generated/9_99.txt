GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the name of the framework program from ec_framework_programs that is associated with a project title other than "A contribution to the fundamental understanding of Shear-Refinement of polymer melts by entanglement manipulation".
(1) Get the name of the framework program for all projects, excluding "A contribution to the fundamental understanding of Shear-Refinement of polymer melts by entanglement manipulation".
(2) Retrieve the name of the framework program from the EC Framework Programs table where the title of a project is not "A contribution to the fundamental understanding of Shear-Refinement of polymer melts by entanglement manipulation".
(3) What are the names of the EC framework programs that are associated with projects, excluding "A contribution to the fundamental understanding of Shear-Refinement of polymer melts by entanglement manipulation"?
(4) Retrieve the name of all framework programs from ec_framework_programs where the project title is not "A contribution to the fundamental understanding of Shear-Refinement of polymer melts by entanglement manipulation".
(5) Retrieve the name of all framework programs from the "ec_framework_programs" table that have been used in a project other than "A contribution to the fundamental understanding of Shear-Refinement of polymer melts by entanglement manipulation".
(6) What is the name of the framework program for projects that are not titled "A contribution to the fundamental understanding of Shear-Refinement of polymer melts by entanglement manipulation"?
(7) Retrieve the name of the framework program for projects that are not titled "A contribution to the fundamental understanding of Shear-Refinement of polymer melts by entanglement manipulation".
