GPT-3 choices:
(0) Get the names of the framework programs from the EC Framework Programs table that match with the framework program used in projects where the EC call is "FP7-REGIONS-2007-1".
(1) What are the names of all the EC framework programs that were used in projects with the call "FP7-REGIONS-2007-1"?
(2) Retrieve the name of the framework program from ec_framework_programs that is listed as the framework program in projects where the ec_call is "FP7-REGIONS-2007-1".
(3) Retrieve the name of each framework program from ec_framework_programs where the framework program matches the value of "FP7-REGIONS-2007-1" in the ec_call column of projects.
(4) What are the names of all framework programs associated with projects that have an EC call of "FP7-REGIONS-2007-1"?
(5) Get the name of all the framework programs from ec_framework_programs table that match with the values in the framework_program column from projects table where ec_call is equal to "FP7-REGIONS-2007-1".
(6) Get the framework program name from the EC framework programs table for all projects where the EC call is "FP7-REGIONS-2007-1".
(7) Retrieve the framework program name from ec_framework_programs where the ec_call for projects is "FP7-REGIONS-2007-1".
