Original Query:
SELECT T1.geocode_regions FROM eu_territorial_units AS T1 JOIN institutions AS T2 ON T1.geocode_regions = T2.geocode_regions_3 WHERE T2.short_name = "UdA"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) What are the geocode regions for institutions that have a short name of "UdA" and are in the same region as eu_territorial_units?
(1) Get the geocode regions from the EU territorial units where the short name of institutions is "UdA" and their geocode regions match with those in institutions.
(2) Retrieve the geocode regions from the European Territorial Units table where the geocode_regions_3 value in the Institutions table is equal to "UdA".
(3) Retrieve the geocode_regions value from the eu_territorial_units table where the institutions table's geocode_regions_3 value is equal to "UdA" for the short_name column.
(4) Find the geocode regions from the EU territorial units table where the short name in the institutions table is "UdA".
(5) Get the geocode_regions column from the eu_territorial_units table where the geocode_regions_3 column in the institutions table matches "UdA" for its short_name.
(6) Get the geocode_regions for the EU territorial units and institutions where the short name is "UdA".
(7) Retrieve the geocode_regions from the eu_territorial_units table where the short name of institutions is "UdA".
