GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the code for all research domains that are part of a panel and have a project with an EC maximum contribution of 11994553.0.
(1) Find the research domain code for a project with an EC max contribution of 11994553.0 by joining the erc_research_domains table with the erc_panels and project_erc_panels tables, and filtering for projects in which the panel is a part of and has a code that matches the project's unics_id.
(2) Find the code for the research domain in the ERC research domains table that is also listed as part of a panel in the ERC panels table, which is then linked to a project in the project ERC panels table and has a maximum EC contribution value of 11994553.0 in the projects table.
(3) Retrieve the research domain code from erc_research_domains for projects where the EC max contribution is equal to 11994553.0 and is a part of an ERC panel, which in turn is a part of the project_erc_panels table that has a corresponding entry in the projects table with matching unics_id.
(4) Find the code of all ERC research domains that are part of a panel, which is associated with a project that has an EC maximum contribution value of 11994553.0.
(5) Find the research domain codes for all ERC panels that are part of a project with an EC max contribution of 11994553.0.
(6) What are the research domains of projects that have an EC max contribution of 11994553.0 and are part of a panel within the ERC panels?
(7) Get the research domains code for all ERC panels that are a part of and have a maximum EC contribution of 11994553.0 in projects.
