Original Query:
SELECT T1.nuts_version FROM eu_territorial_units AS T1 JOIN institutions AS T2 ON T1.geocode_regions = T2.geocode_regions_3 WHERE T2.country_id = 65
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the nuts version from the eu_territorial_units table for the country with a country_id of 65 by joining it with the institutions table on their respective geocode_regions and limiting to only those where the geocode_regions_3 values match.
(1) Get the nuts version from the EU territorial units for institutions located in country 65, where the geocode regions in both tables match.
(2) Find the NUTS version for all European Union territorial units where the country ID is equal to 65 and the geocode regions in both tables match.
(3) Find the NUTS version of EU territorial units for institutions located in country with ID 65.
(4) Find the NUTS version from the EU territorial units table for the country with a country ID of 65, by joining it with the institutions table and matching on their shared geocode_regions_3 field.
(5) Retrieve the NUTS version from the EU territorial units table for a country with a country ID of 65 by joining it with the institutions table on matching geocode regions.
(6) Retrieve the NUTS version from the EU territorial units table where the geocode regions match between the institutions and EU territorial units tables, specifically for institutions located in country with ID 65.
(7) Retrieve the version of NUTS (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) for all institutions located in country 65 by joining the tables eu_territorial_units and institutions on their respective geocode_regions columns.
