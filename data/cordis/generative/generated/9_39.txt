GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the codes of all funding schemes for projects where the principal investigator is not 1211174.
(1) What are the codes of all funding schemes that have been used for projects where the principal investigator is not 1211174?
(2) Retrieve the funding scheme codes from the funding_schemes table for all projects that have a principal investigator different from 1211174.
(3) What are the funding schemes' codes of all projects that do not have a principal investigator with the ID 1211174?
(4) Find the code for funding schemes where the principal investigator is not 1211174 in the projects table, joined with the funding schemes table on matching codes.
(5) Retrieve the code for all funding schemes from the funding_schemes table that are associated with projects where the principal investigator is not 1211174.
(6) Find the code for all funding schemes where the principal investigator is not 1211174 from a table that joins the funding_schemes and projects tables on the condition that the code matches the ec_fund_scheme column in projects.
(7) Get the funding scheme code for all projects where the principal investigator is not 1211174.
