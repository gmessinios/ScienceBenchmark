Original Query:
SELECT T1.ec_framework_program_name FROM ec_framework_programs AS T1 JOIN projects AS T2 ON T1.ec_framework_program_name = T2.framework_program WHERE T2.framework_program != "H2020"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the names of all framework programs from the table ec_framework_programs where the project's framework program is not equal to "H2020".
(1) Find all framework programs from the EC Framework Programs table where the corresponding project's framework program is not equal to "H2020".
(2) What are the names of framework programs that have been used in projects other than H2020?
(3) Get the names of all framework programs from the table "ec_framework_programs" that are associated with projects in which the framework program is not equal to "H2020".
(4) What are the names of all the framework programs that have been used in projects, excluding "H2020"?
(5) Show me the framework program names from EC Framework Programs where the framework program is not equal to "H2020" for projects.
(6) Get the names of all framework programs from the ec_framework_programs table that are associated with projects in the projects table, but excluding those with "H2020" as their framework program.
(7) Retrieve the name of the framework program from the EC Framework Programs table where the framework program is not "H2020" in the Projects table.
