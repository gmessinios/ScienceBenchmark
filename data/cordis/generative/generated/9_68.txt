Original Query:
SELECT T1.description FROM eu_territorial_units AS T1 JOIN institutions AS T2 ON T1.geocode_regions = T2.geocode_regions_3 WHERE T2.grid_id != "grid.8073.c"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the descriptions of EU territorial units from the institutions table, specifically for those institutions that do not have a grid ID of "grid.8073.c".
(1) Retrieve the description of European territorial units from institutions where the geocode regions of the two tables match and the grid ID is not "grid.8073.c".
(2) Retrieve the descriptions of European territorial units where the grid_id is not equal to "grid.8073.c" from institutions that have matching geocode_regions in both tables.
(3) Retrieve the description of European territorial units where institutions are located, excluding those with grid_id "grid.8073.c".
(4) Retrieve the description of European territorial units from institutions where the geocode regions in eu_territorial_units match with geocode regions_3 in institutions and exclude grid_id "grid.8073.c".
(5) Retrieve the description of the territorial units from the EU and join it with the institutions based on their geocode_regions_3, excluding those with a grid_id of "grid.8073.c".
(6) Retrieve the description of European Union territorial units from institutions where the geocode regions match and the grid ID is not equal to "grid.8073.c".
(7) What are the descriptions of EU territorial units associated with institutions whose grid ID is not "grid.8073.c"?
