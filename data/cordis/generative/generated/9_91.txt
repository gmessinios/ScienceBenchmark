Original Query:
SELECT T1.member_name FROM project_members AS T1 JOIN eu_territorial_units AS T2 ON T1.geocode_regions_3 = T2.geocode_regions WHERE T2.geocode_level != 2
GPT-3 choices:
(0) "Retrieve the names of members from the project_members table who belong to EU territorial units at a geocode level other than 2."
(1) "Retrieve the names of all project members from the EU territorial units table where their geocode regions do not have a level of 2."
(2) What are the names of all members who belong to a project and are located in an EU territorial unit that is not at the level 2 geocode?
(3) Get the member names of all project members from the "project_members" table where the geocode level of their corresponding region in the "eu_territorial_units" table is not equal to 2.
(4) Retrieve the names of project members who are located in territorial units that are not at the second level of geographical coding.
(5) Get the names of all project members whose geocode regions at level 3 are different from level 2.
(6) Get the names of all members from the project_members table who are associated with a geocode_regions_3 value that is not at the geocode_level 2 in the eu_territorial_units table.
(7) Retrieve the names of all project members who are associated with any territorial unit that is not at level 2.
