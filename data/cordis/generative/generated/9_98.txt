Original Query:
SELECT T1.geocode_regions FROM eu_territorial_units AS T1 JOIN project_members AS T2 ON T1.geocode_regions = T2.geocode_regions_3 WHERE T2.city != "PULPI ALMERIA"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the geocode regions from the European Territorial Units that match with the geocode regions in the Project Members table where the city is not "Pulpi Almeria".
(1) "Get the geocode regions from EU territorial units where the city of project members is not "PULPI ALMERIA"."
(2) Return the geocode regions from the EU territorial units where the city is not "Pulpi Almeria" and join it with project members using the third geocode region.
(3) Retrieve the geocode regions from the EU territorial units where the city is not "Pulpi Almeria" and join it with the project members' geocode regions.
(4) Retrieve the geocode_regions column from the eu_territorial_units table where the city column of project_members is not equal to "PULPI ALMERIA".
(5) Retrieve the geocode regions from EU territorial units where the city is not "PULPI ALMERIA" for project members.
(6) Retrieve the geocode_regions from eu_territorial_units for all project members whose city is not "PULPI ALMERIA" and their geocode_regions_3 matches.
(7) Retrieve the geocode regions from the eu_territorial_units table where the city in project_members is not equal to "PULPI ALMERIA" and matches in both tables are joined.
