GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the framework program names from the "ec_framework_programs" table for projects with an "ec_fund_scheme" of "Shift2Rail-RIA".
(1) What are the names of all framework programs listed in the Shift2Rail-RIA fund scheme that have corresponding projects?
(2) "Retrieve the name of the framework program from the ec_framework_programs table for projects with an ec_fund_scheme value of "Shift2Rail-RIA".
(3) What are the names of the framework programs associated with projects that have an EC fund scheme of "Shift2Rail-RIA"?
(4) What are the names of the EC framework programs that are listed as the framework program for projects that have an EC fund scheme of "Shift2Rail-RIA"?
(5) Show the name of the framework program from the table "ec_framework_programs" that matches the value in the "framework_program" column of the "projects" table where the value in the "ec_fund_scheme" column is equal to "Shift2Rail-RIA".
(6) Get the names of the framework programs from the table "ec_framework_programs" where the ec_fund_scheme in the table "projects" is equal to "Shift2Rail-RIA".
(7) Retrieve the name of all framework programs from the EC Framework Programs table where the project's framework program matches "Shift2Rail-RIA" in the Projects table.
