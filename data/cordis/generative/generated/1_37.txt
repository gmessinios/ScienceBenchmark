Original Query:
SELECT T1.code FROM activity_types AS T1 JOIN project_members AS T2 ON T1.code = T2.activity_type WHERE T2.pic_number = "894534195"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Get the activity type code from the activity_types table where the project member's pic number is "894534195" and their activity type matches.
(1) What is the code for the activity type of a project member with a PIC number of "894534195"?
(2) Retrieve the code of the activity type from the project members table where the PIC number is "894534195" and it matches with the code in the activity types table.
(3) "Retrieve the code for the activity type from the project members table where the PIC number is "894534195"."
(4) Retrieve the code of all activity types for a project where the project member's PIC number is "894534195".
(5) Find the code of activity types from the project members table where the PIC number is "894534195" and join it with the activity types table.
(6) Retrieve the activity type codes for a project member with a PIC number of "894534195" by joining the activity_types and project_members tables and selecting the code from activity_types where it matches the project member's activity type.
(7) Find the code for all activity types that match the activity type of a project member with a PIC number of "894534195".
