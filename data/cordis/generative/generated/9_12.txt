Original Query:
SELECT T1.ec_framework_program_name FROM ec_framework_programs AS T1 JOIN projects AS T2 ON T1.ec_framework_program_name = T2.framework_program WHERE T2.start_year != "None"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the names of all framework programs that are associated with projects where the start year is not "None".
(1) Retrieve the framework program names from the table ec_framework_programs where those names also appear in the "framework_program" column of the projects table, but only for projects where the start_year is not equal to "None".
(2) Show the name of the framework program for all projects that have a start year that is not equal to "None".
(3) Retrieve the name of each program in the EC framework that has been used as a framework program in at least one project with a specified start year.
(4) Find the name of the framework program from the table "ec_framework_programs" that is used in projects, but only if the project's start year is not listed as "None".
(5) Show the framework program names from the EC framework programs table where the start year for a project is not "None".
(6) Find the names of all framework programs from the table ec_framework_programs that are mentioned in the column "framework_program" in the table projects, as long as the start_year for those projects is not "None".
(7) What are the names of all framework programs that have been used in projects where the start year is not "None"?
