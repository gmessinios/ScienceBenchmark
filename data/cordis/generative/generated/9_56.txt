Original Query:
SELECT T1.rcn FROM topics AS T1 JOIN project_topics AS T3 ON T1.code = T3.topic JOIN projects AS T2 ON T3.project = T2.unics_id WHERE T2.acronym != "GEOCLIME"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) What are the research code numbers for topics that are related to projects with an acronym other than "GEOCLIME"?
(1) Find the RCN number of all topics that are associated with projects (excluding the project with acronym "GEOCLIME") through the code in project_topics.
(2) Get the research code numbers (rcn) for topics that are associated with projects, where the project's acronym is not "GEOCLIME".
(3) Retrieve the research topic codes for all projects, except "GEOCLIME", by joining the tables topics, project_topics, and projects on their corresponding columns.
(4) "Retrieve the research topic codes for all projects, excluding those with the acronym 'GEOCLIME', that are associated with a specific research topic."
(5) Retrieve the research topic code from the topics table for projects that are not affiliated with "GEOCLIME" by joining the topics, project_topics, and projects tables.
(6) Retrieve the research topic codes for all projects, excluding "GEOCLIME", by joining the tables topics, project_topics, and projects and selecting the topic codes from topics that are connected to the project through project_topics.
(7) Find the research council number (rcn) for topics that have been assigned to projects with acronyms other than "GEOCLIME".
