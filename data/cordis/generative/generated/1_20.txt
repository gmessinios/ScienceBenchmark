GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the research domain codes for all ERC panels that are part of a project with a start year of 2009.
(1) Find the research domains of projects that belong to panels which are part of ERC research domains, and were funded in 2009.
(2) Retrieve the codes for research domains from 2009 projects that are part of a panel within the European Research Council's panels.
(3) Get the research domain codes for all ERC panels that are part of a project in which the project's start year is 2009.
(4) Find the codes of all research domains that are a part of an ERC panel which is associated with projects starting in 2009.
(5) Retrieve the codes for research domains that are associated with panels listed in project_erc_panels and were used in projects that started in 2009.
(6) What are the ERC research domains that are part of ERC panels for projects that started in 2009?
(7) Find the research domain codes for all projects that were started in the year 2009 by joining the erc_research_domains and erc_panels tables, and then joining with the project_erc_panels and projects tables to retrieve only those panels that are part of a project with a start year of 2009.
