Original Query:
SELECT T1.code FROM activity_types AS T1 JOIN project_members AS T2 ON T1.code = T2.activity_type WHERE T2.member_short_name != "GMV UK"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Get the activity type codes for all project members whose member short name is not "GMV UK".
(1) Find the code for activity types that are associated with project members who are not identified as "GMV UK".
(2) What is the code of all activity types for which there exists a project member who has a different short name than "GMV UK"?
(3) Get the code of all activity types where the member's short name is not "GMV UK" and who are also project members.
(4) Find the activity type code for all project members who are not "GMV UK" by joining the tables activity_types and project_members on their common code column.
(5) Retrieve the code of all activity types that are associated with a project member other than "GMV UK".
(6) Retrieve the code of all activity types where the member's short name is not "GMV UK" from the project members table, while joining with the activity types table.
(7) Retrieve the code of activity types from the activity_types table for project members who are not "GMV UK".
