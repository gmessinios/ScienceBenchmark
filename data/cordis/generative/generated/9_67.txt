Original Query:
SELECT T1.code FROM project_member_roles AS T1 JOIN project_members AS T2 ON T1.code = T2.member_role WHERE T2.latitude != 19.3290208
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Get the code for project member roles from the table project_member_roles where the latitude of project members is not equal to 19.3290208.
(1) Retrieve the role code from the project member roles table for members in the project members table whose latitude is not equal to 19.3290208.
(2) Find the project member roles for all project members who do not have a latitude of 19.3290208.
(3) Find the project member roles' codes for members of a project whose latitude is not equal to 19.3290208.
(4) Find the role codes for project members who have a member role that is not equal to 19.3290208 and also have a non-null latitude value in the project_member_roles and project_members tables.
(5) Show me the codes of project member roles for all project members whose latitude is not equal to 19.3290208.
(6) Retrieve the role code from project_member_roles for all project_members who do not have a latitude of 19.3290208.
(7) Retrieve the code of all project member roles where the latitude of their corresponding project members is not equal to 19.3290208.
