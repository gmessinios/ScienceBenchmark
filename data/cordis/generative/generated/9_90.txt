Original Query:
SELECT T1.description FROM activity_types AS T1 JOIN project_members AS T2 ON T1.code = T2.activity_type WHERE T2.member_role != "participant"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Get the description of the activity type from the project members' activity types table for all project members who do not have a role of "participant".
(1) Retrieve the description of activity types from the project members table where the member role is not equal to "participant".
(2) Retrieve the descriptions of all activity types from the project members table where the member role is not equal to "participant".
(3) What are the descriptions of all activity types that project members are involved in, excluding those with the role of "participant"?
(4) Find the description of all activity types for project members who do not have the role of "participant".
(5) Retrieve the description of all activity types from the project_members table where the member_role is not "participant", joined with the activity_types table on matching activity type codes.
(6) Retrieve the description of all activity types from the project_members table, excluding those where the member_role is "participant", by joining with the activity_types table and matching on the activity_type code.
(7) "Retrieve the description from activity_types where the activity_type code matches the project_members' activity_type and the member_role is not equal to 'participant'."
