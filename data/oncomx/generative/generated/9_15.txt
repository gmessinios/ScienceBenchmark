Original Query:
SELECT T1.peptide_pos FROM disease_mutation AS T1 JOIN disease_mutation_impact_prediction AS T2 ON T1.id = T2.disease_mutation_id WHERE T2.id != 9737
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the peptide position from disease_mutation table where the id of disease_mutation_impact_prediction table is not equal to 9737 and both tables are joined on the primary key of disease_mutation.
(1) Find the peptide position of disease mutations with an impact prediction that is not equal to 9737.
(2) What is the position of the peptide for all disease mutations where the impact prediction ID is not equal to 9737?
(3) Retrieve the peptide positions from the disease mutation table where the impact prediction id is not 9737, joined with the disease mutation impact prediction table on their respective IDs.
(4) Find the position of the peptide for all disease mutations that have an impact prediction other than 9737.
(5) Retrieve the peptide position from disease mutations where the impact prediction ID is not equal to 9737, joined with the disease mutation impact prediction table on matching IDs.
(6) Retrieve the peptide positions for disease mutations that have a disease mutation impact prediction ID other than 9737.
(7) Find the position of the peptides for all disease mutations where the impact prediction ID is not equal to 9737.
