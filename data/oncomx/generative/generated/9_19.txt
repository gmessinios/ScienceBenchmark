Original Query:
SELECT T1.disease_mutation_id FROM disease_mutation_article AS T1 JOIN disease_mutation AS T2 ON T1.disease_mutation_id = T2.id WHERE T2.chromosome_id != "10"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the ID of all disease mutations that have articles associated with them, but only for those disease mutations where the chromosome is not equal to 10.
(1) Get the disease-mutation IDs from articles where the chromosome ID associated with the disease mutation is not equal to "10".
(2) Find the disease mutation IDs from articles where the associated disease mutations are on chromosomes other than chromosome 10.
(3) Retrieve the disease mutation IDs from articles for diseases that are not associated with chromosome 10.
(4) Get the disease mutation IDs from the disease mutation articles where the chromosome ID in the associated disease mutation is not equal to "10".
(5) Find the disease mutation IDs from articles related to diseases where the corresponding chromosome is not 10.
(6) Retrieve the disease mutation IDs from the disease mutation articles for which the associated disease mutations are located on chromosomes other than chromosome 10.
(7) Find the disease mutation IDs for articles related to disease mutations that are not associated with chromosome 10.
