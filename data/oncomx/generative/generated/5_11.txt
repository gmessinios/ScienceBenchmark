Original Query:
SELECT T1.disease_mutation_id FROM disease_mutation_site_annotation AS T1    ORDER BY T1.id DESC LIMIT 1
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the most recent disease mutation ID from the disease mutation site annotation table, ordered by descending ID and limited to 1 result.
(1) Retrieve the disease mutation ID of the last entry in the disease_mutation_site_annotation table, ordered by descending ID.
(2) Get the disease mutation ID from the table "disease_mutation_site_annotation" in descending order by ID, with a limit of 1.
(3) Retrieve the id of the disease mutation site from the disease_mutation_site_annotation table, ordered in descending order by the id column and returning only the last result.
(4) Retrieve the disease mutation ID from the disease_mutation_site_annotation table, where the results are sorted in descending order by the ID and only the last record is selected.
(5) "Retrieve the ID of the most recent entry in the disease_mutation_site_annotation table, ordered by descending ID."
(6) "Get the disease mutation ID from the disease_mutation_site_annotation table, ordered by the ID in descending order, and only return the last row."
(7) Find the ID of the latest disease mutation from the disease_mutation_site_annotation table.
