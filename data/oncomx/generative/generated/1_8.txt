Original Query:
SELECT T1.uberon_anatomical_id FROM cancer_tissue AS T1 JOIN disease AS T2 ON T1.doid = T2.id WHERE T2.id = 263
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the uberon anatomical ID of cancer tissue where the disease is associated with DOID 263.
(1) Get the UBeron anatomical ID from cancer tissues where the disease is identified as 263.
(2) What is the Uberon anatomical ID for cancer tissues associated with disease 263?
(3) What is the Uberon anatomical ID for cancer tissue associated with disease with ID 263?
(4) Retrieve the uberon anatomical ID for all cancer tissues associated with a disease with an ID of 263.
(5) Find the Uberon anatomical ID of cancer tissues associated with the disease with the ID 263.
(6) Retrieve the anatomical ID from the cancer_tissue table where the disease ID is 263 and it matches with the disease ID in the disease table.
(7) Find the Uberon anatomical ID for cancer tissue associated with the disease "hemangioma" (disease ID: 263).
