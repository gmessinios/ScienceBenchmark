###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.biomarker_fda_id FROM biomarker_fda_ncit_term AS T1 WHERE T1.ncit_biomarker != "GPR160"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the ID of all FDA biomarkers from the table biomarker_fda_ncit_term where the NCIt biomarker is not "GPR160".
(1) Find the biomarker FDA ID for all entries in the table "biomarker_fda_ncit_term" where the NCIT biomarker is not equal to "GPR160".
(2) Find the biomarker FDA ID for all entries in the table biomarker_fda_ncit_term where the NCIT biomarker is not equal to "GPR160".
(3) Find the biomarker FDA ID for all entries in the table "biomarker_fda_ncit_term" where the corresponding NCIT biomarker is not equal to "GPR160".
(4) What is the biomarker_fda_id for a biomarker_fda_ncit_term where its ncit_biomarker is not "GPR160"?
(5) Retrieve the FDA biomarker ID for all terms in the NCIt biomarker list except for "GPR160".
(6) What is the NCIt biomarker term for the FDA biomarker with the ID "GPR160"?
(7) What is the FDA biomarker ID for the NCIT biomarker "GPR160"?
