GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the names of diseases from the database that are associated with cancer tissues, excluding any that pertain to breast tissue.
(1) Get the name of diseases from the "disease" table that are associated with an entry in the "cancer_tissue" table where the disease id matches the doid and also excludes entries with uberon_anatomical_id of UBERON:0000992.
(2) Get the names of diseases from the disease table that have a matching ID in the cancer_tissue table, but only if their corresponding anatomical ID in the uberon_anatomical_id column is not equal to "UBERON:0000992".
(3) Retrieve the names of all diseases that are associated with cancer tissues, excluding those associated with anatomical entity "UBERON:0000992".
(4) List the names of diseases that are associated with a type of cancer located in a tissue other than the heart.
(5) Retrieve the name of diseases from the table "disease" that are also present in the "cancer_tissue" table and have a matching ID in both tables, excluding any that have an anatomical ID of "UBERON:0000992".
(6) Retrieve the names of diseases associated with cancer tissues, excluding those related to the urinary bladder.
(7) Get the names of diseases that are associated with cancer tissues, excluding those related to skin tissue.
