GPT-3 choices:
(0) Select DOIDs of cancer tissue from the table cancer_tissue and the anatomical_entity table, where the UBeron anatomical ID in the cancer_tissue table is equal to the ID in the anatomical_entity table, but exclude cases where the description in the anatomical_entity table is "Region of cortex near to the rhinal sulcus. It is defined differently in different nomenclatures, due in part to the lack of agreement on the definition of the border of this region. In addition
(1) What is the DOID of cancer tissues that are associated with anatomical entities other than the region of cortex near the rhinal sulcus, which can have different definitions depending on nomenclature and location?
(2) Find the disease names from the Cancer Tissue table where the associated Ubiquitous ID in the Anatomical Entity table is not equal to "Region of cortex near to the rhinal sulcus". The differences in definition for this region contribute to discrepancies between different nomenclatures. Specifically, in rats, it only encompasses caudal levels of the rhinal sulcus, while in monkeys it covers the entire rostrocaudal extent.
(3) What is the name of the cancer tissue in which the description of the corresponding anatomical entity is not equal to "Region of cortex near to the rhinal sulcus. It is defined differently in different nomenclatures, due in part to the lack of agreement on the definition of the border of this region. In the rat, the perirhinal cortex occupies only caudal levels of the rhinal sulcus while in the monkey, it occurpies
the full rostrocaud
(4) Get the disease ontology identifier for all DOID terms from cancer_tissue where the description of the anatomical_entity is not "Region of cortex near to the rhinal sulcus. It is defined differently in different nomenclatures, due in part to the lack of agreement on the definition of the border of this region. In the rat, the perirhinal cortex occupies only caudal levels of the rhinal sulcus while in the monkey, it occurpies the full rostro
(5) Select DOID of cancer tissues from anatomical entities where the UBE
(6) What is the DOID for cancer tissue that corresponds to an anatomical entity where the description is not "Region of cortex near to the rhinal sulcus. It is defined differently in different nomenclatures, due in part to the lack of agreement on the definition of the border of this region. In the rat, the perirhinal cortex occupies only caudal levels of the rhinal sulcus while in the monkey, it occurpies the full rostrocaudal extent of
(7) Retrieve the DOID of cancer tissues where the UBE
