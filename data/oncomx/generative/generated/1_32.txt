Original Query:
SELECT T1.name FROM stage AS T1 JOIN healthy_expression AS T2 ON T1.id = T2.uberon_developmental_id WHERE T2.expression_level_gene_relative = "LOW"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) "Retrieve the name of all stages where the relative expression level of genes is low in healthy developmental tissue based on data from the stage and healthy_expression tables."
(1) Retrieve the names of all stages where the relative expression level of a gene in healthy tissue is "LOW" from the stage and healthy_expression tables, using the developmental ID from stage and joining it with uberon_developmental_id from healthy_expression.
(2) What are the names of stages where the relative expression level of genes is "LOW" in healthy expressions?
(3) Find the names of all stages where the expression level for a gene in healthy tissue is considered "LOW" based on data from both the stage and healthy_expression tables.
(4) What is the name of the stage where genes have a low relative expression level in healthy developmental tissues?
(5) What is the name of the developmental stage where the relative gene expression level is considered low, based on data from the table "stage" and "healthy_expression"?
(6) Retrieve the names of all developmental stages for which the relative expression level of a gene is considered "LOW" in healthy individuals based on data from the stage and healthy_expression tables.
(7) Find the name of stages where the expression level of a gene is considered "LOW" according to data from healthy_expression and stage tables.
