###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.biomarker_fda_id FROM biomarker_fda_ncit_term AS T1 WHERE T1.ncit_biomarker != "Deoxycytidine Kinase Gene"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) What is the FDA biomarker ID for a biomarker that is not the "Deoxycytidine Kinase Gene"?
(1) Find all FDA biomarker IDs where the corresponding NCIt biomarker is not "Deoxycytidine Kinase Gene".
(2) Find the FDA biomarker IDs for all entries in the table biomarker_fda_ncit_term where the corresponding NCIt biomarker is not "Deoxycytidine Kinase Gene".
(3) What is the FDA biomarker ID for all entries in the table where the NCIt biomarker is not equal to "Deoxycytidine Kinase Gene"?
(4) Retrieve the biomarker FDA ID from the table "biomarker_fda_ncit_term" where the NCIt biomarker is not "Deoxycytidine Kinase Gene".
(5) Find the FDA biomarker ID for biomarkers that have an NCIt term other than "Deoxycytidine Kinase Gene".
(6) What is the FDA biomarker ID for all biomarkers that are not related to the "Deoxycytidine Kinase Gene"?
(7) "Retrieve the biomarker FDA ID from the Biomarker FDA NCIT Term table where the NCIT biomarker is not "Deoxycytidine Kinase Gene"."
