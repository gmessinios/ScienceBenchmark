GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the aliases for biomarkers from the table biomarker_alias where the description does not match a specific gene type.
(1) Find all the aliases for biomarkers that have an alias and are not associated with a description from NCBI Gene that states they are similar to E-type nucleotidases (NTPases)/ecto-ATPase/apyrases and contain 4 apyrase-conserved regions.
(2) Return all biomarker aliases from the biomarker_alias table for biomarkers in the biomarker table that do not have a description of "From NCBI Gene: The protein encoded by this gene is similar to E-type nucleotidases (NTPases)/ecto-ATPase/apyrases. NTPases, such as CD39, mediate catabolism of extracellular nucleotides. ENTPD5 contains 4 apyrase-conserved regions which is
(3) Find all biomarker aliases for biomarkers with descriptions that are not equal to "From NCBI Gene: The protein encoded by this gene is similar to E-type nucleotidases (NTPases)/ecto-ATPase/apyrases. NTPases, such as CD39, mediate catabolism of extracellular nucleotides. ENTPD5 contains 4 apyrase-conserved regions which is characteristic of NTPases."
(4) Retrieve the aliases from the biomarker_alias table where the description in the biomarker table is not "From NCBI Gene: The protein encoded by this gene is similar to E-type nucleotidases (NTPases)/ecto-ATPase/apyrases. NTPases, such as CD39, mediate catabolism of extracellular nucleotides. ENTPD5 contains 4 apyrase-conserved regions which is characteristic of NTPases. [
