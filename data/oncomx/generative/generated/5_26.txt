Original Query:
SELECT T1.test_approval_status FROM biomarker_fda_test AS T1    ORDER BY T1.test_number_genes DESC LIMIT 1
GPT-3 choices:
(0) What is the approval status of the test with the highest number of genes from the FDA biomarker test database, ordered by descending gene count?
(1) Find the approval status for the test with the highest number of genes in the biomarker_fda_test table.
(2) What is the approval status of the FDA test with the highest number of genes in the biomarker_fda_test table?
(3) Find the FDA test approval status for the biomarker with the highest number of genes in descending order.
(4) What is the FDA approval status of the test with the highest number of genes in the biomarker_fda_test table?
(5) Retrieve the approval status of the test with the highest number of genes from the biomarker_fda_test table, ordered by descending gene count.
(6) Get the approval status of the most recent FDA test for biomarkers, ordered by the number of genes tested, limited to one result.
(7) Retrieve the approval status of the test with the highest number of genes from the biomarker FDA test table, sorted in descending order.
