GPT-3 choices:
(0) "Get the test trade name from the FDA biomarker database for all drugs except the one with ID 'FDA000037'."
(1) Retrieve the trade names of biomarkers that are not associated with drug "FDA000037".
(2) What are the trade names of all biomarkers in the FDA database, excluding those with the ID "FDA000037" and their corresponding drugs?
(3) "Retrieve the test trade name from the FDA biomarker database for all biomarkers that are not associated with drug ID "FDA000037"."
(4) Show me the trade names for all FDA-approved biomarkers, excluding those with the ID "FDA000037".
(5) Find the test trade name from the biomarker FDA table where the ID in the biomarker FDA drug table is not equal to "FDA000037".
(6) Get the test trade names for biomarkers that are not equal to "FDA000037" from the FDA biomarker table, joined with the FDA biomarker drug table.
(7) Retrieve the test trade name from the FDA-approved biomarker list for drugs that are not associated with FDA000037.
