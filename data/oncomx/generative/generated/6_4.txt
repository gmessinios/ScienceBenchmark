GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the ID of the anatomical entity "islet of Langerhans" that has a description mentioning the role it plays in pain modulation and defensive behavior, as well as its connection to the cerebral aqueduct and midbrain.
(1) Retrieve the ID of the anatomical entity "islet of Langerhans" with the description "Periaqueductal gray (PAG; also called the 'central gray') is located around the cerebral aqueduct within the midbrain and plays a role in pain modulation and defensive behaviour, receiving information from ascending pain and temperature fibers via the spinomesencephalic tract originating in the spine and terminating in the midbrain."
(2) Find the ID of the anatomical entity named "islet of Langerhans" and with a description stating that it is located in the periaqueductal gray (PAG) region of the midbrain, which plays a role in pain modulation and defensive behavior.
(3) Find the ID of the anatomical entity "islet of Langerhans" with the description "Periaqueductal gray (PAG; also called the 'central gray') is located around the cerebral aqueduct within the midbrain and plays a role in pain modulation and defensive behavior by receiving information from ascending pain and temperature fibers via the spinomesencephalic tract originating in the spine."
(4) What is the ID of the anatomical entity "islet of Langerhans" that has a name and description matching those specified, where the periaqueductal gray (PAG) refers to gray matter located around the cerebral aqueduct in the midbrain that is involved in modulating pain and defensive behavior, receiving information from the ascending pain and temperature fibers via the spinomesencephalic tract?
(5) What is the ID of the anatomical entity called "islet of Langerhans" that has a description mentioning its role in pain modulation and defensive behavior, receiving information from ascending fibers and originating in the spine?
(6) Find the ID of the anatomical entity "islet of Langerhans" with a description that includes information about its location in the brain and its role in pain modulation and defensive behavior.
(7) What is the ID of the anatomical entity named "islet of Langerhans" with a description of "Periaqueductal gray (PAG; also called the 'central gray') which plays a role in pain modulation and defensive behavior, receives information from the spinothalamic tract via the spinomesencephalic tract, and is located around the cerebral aqueduct within the midbrain"?
