Original Query:
SELECT T1.cds_pos FROM disease_mutation AS T1    ORDER BY T1.id DESC LIMIT 1
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the coding sequence position from the latest entry in the disease_mutation table, ordered by descending id and limiting to 1.
(1) Retrieve the coding sequence position from the most recently added entry in the disease_mutation table.
(2) Retrieve the coding sequence position from the most recent entry in the table "disease_mutation".
(3) Retrieve the coding sequence position from the most recent entry in the disease_mutation table, ordered by id in descending order and limited to one entry.
(4) What is the latest CDS position recorded in the disease_mutation table?
(5) What is the coding sequence position of the most recent disease mutation entry in the database?
(6) What is the last CDS position for disease mutations in the disease_mutation table, ordered by descending id?
(7) Get the CDS positions of all disease mutations in descending order, limited to the last entry in the table.
