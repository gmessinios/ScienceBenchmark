Original Query:
SELECT T1.gene_symbol FROM xref_gene_ensembl AS T1 JOIN species AS T2 ON T1.speciesid = T2.speciesid WHERE T2.species != "sapiens"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the gene symbols from the xref_gene_ensembl table for species that are not "sapiens".
(1) Retrieve the gene symbol from the cross-reference table for genes on species other than "sapiens".
(2) Retrieve the gene symbols from the xref_gene_ensembl table for all species that are not "sapiens".
(3) Retrieve the gene symbols from the xref_gene_ensembl table for all species except "sapiens".
(4) Retrieve the gene symbol from the xref_gene_ensembl table for all species except "sapiens" by joining it with the species table and using the speciesid to identify each record.
(5) Retrieve the gene symbol from the table xref_gene_ensembl for all entries where the species is not "sapiens".
(6) What are the gene symbols for genes in species other than "sapiens"?
(7) Retrieve the gene symbols from the cross-reference table for genes in all species except for "sapiens".
