Original Query:
SELECT T1.pmid FROM disease_mutation_article AS T1 JOIN disease_mutation AS T2 ON T1.disease_mutation_id = T2.id WHERE T2.mutation_freq = 60
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the PMID values from the disease_mutation_article table for articles where the mutation frequency in the corresponding disease_mutation entry is equal to 60%.
(1) Find the PMID of all articles related to a disease mutation with a frequency of 60%.
(2) Get the PMID of all articles associated with disease-mutation pairs where the mutation frequency is equal to 60%.
(3) Find the PMID numbers for articles related to disease and mutation that have a mutation frequency of 60%.
(4) Retrieve the PMID of articles from the disease_mutation_article table where the corresponding disease_mutation has a mutation frequency of 60.
(5) Find the PMID of articles associated with disease-mutation pairs where the mutation frequency is 60%.
(6) Find the PubMed IDs of articles that contain disease-mutation associations where the frequency of the mutation is 60.
(7) Retrieve the PMID values from the disease_mutation_article table where the mutation frequency is equal to 60 in the corresponding disease_mutation entry.
