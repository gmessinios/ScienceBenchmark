GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the study design used for FDA-approved biomarker tests that are not intended for predisposition testing.
(1) Find the study design of biomarker FDA tests that have been used for purposes other than predisposition.
(2) What are the study designs used for FDA biomarker tests whose actual use is not predisposition?
(3) Retrieve the study design for tests listed in the biomarker_fda_test table that are also included in the biomarker_fda_test_use table, but exclude any tests with an actual use of "predisposition".
(4) Find the study design for biomarker FDA tests that are not used for predisposition.
(5) What is the study design for biomarker FDA tests where the actual use is not predisposition?
(6) Find the study design for biomarker tests that are used for purposes other than predisposition.
(7) Find the study design for biomarker tests that are not used for determining predisposition, based on information from both the biomarker_fda_test and biomarker_fda_test_use tables.
