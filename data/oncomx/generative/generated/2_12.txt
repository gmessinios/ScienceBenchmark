SELECT biomarker_edrn.uberon_anatomical_id, count(*) FROM biomarker_edrn AS biomarker_edrn  GROUP BY biomarker_edrn.uberon_anatomical_id

###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.uberon_anatomical_id, count(*) FROM biomarker_edrn AS T1  GROUP BY T1.uberon_anatomical_id
GPT-3 choices:
(0) How many biomarkers have been recorded for each anatomical location in the EDRN database?
(1) How many counts of unique UBeron anatomical identifiers are there for each entry in the biomarker_edrn table?
(2) Count the number of occurrences in the biomarker_edrn table grouped by the uberon_anatomical_id column.
(3) Count the number of biomarkers for each anatomical region identified by the unique UBERON identifier and group the results by that identifier.
(4) Get the count of all uberon anatomical IDs and group them by the corresponding uberon anatomical ID in the biomarker_edrn table.
(5) "Count the number of biomarkers for each unique uberon anatomical ID in the biomarker_edrn table."
(6) How many biomarkers are associated with each uberon anatomical ID in the EDRN database?
(7) "Retrieve the number of biomarkers associated with each unique anatomical location in the EDRN database."
