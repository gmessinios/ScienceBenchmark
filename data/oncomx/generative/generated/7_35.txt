Original Query:
SELECT T1.tool FROM disease_mutation_impact_prediction AS T1 WHERE T1.id = 3154 or T1.site_prediction = "unknown"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the tool used for disease mutation impact prediction where the ID is 3154 or the site prediction is unknown.
(1) What tool was used for the disease mutation impact prediction with an ID of 3154 or unknown site prediction?
(2) What is the tool used for predicting the impact of a disease mutation with an ID of 3154 or if the site prediction is unknown?
(3) Retrieve the tool used for predicting the impact of a mutation on a disease from the table "disease_mutation_impact_prediction" where either the ID is 3154 or the site prediction is unknown.
(4) Find the name of the tool used for disease mutation impact prediction where the id is 3154 or site prediction is unknown in the disease_mutation_impact_prediction table.
(5) Which tool was used for the disease mutation impact prediction where the ID is 3154 or the site prediction is "unknown"?
(6) What tools were used for predicting the impact of a mutation in the disease mutation impact prediction table with an ID of 3154 or a site prediction of "unknown"?
(7) Retrieve the tool used for predicting the impact of a disease mutation or the site prediction when the id is 3154, or if no site prediction was given.
