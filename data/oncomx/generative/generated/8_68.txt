###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.doid FROM cancer_tissue AS T1 WHERE T1.uberon_anatomical_id != "UBERON:0002048"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the Disease Ontology (DOID) values from cancer_tissue where the corresponding Uberon anatomical identifier is not equal to "UBERON:0002048".
(1) Retrieve the DOIDs from the cancer_tissue table where the associated UBERON anatomical ID is not "UBERON:0002048".
(2) Find the disease ontology IDs from cancer tissues where the associated Uberon anatomical ID is not "UBERON:0002048".
(3) Retrieve the disease ontology ID from the cancer tissue database, where the corresponding Uberon anatomical ID is not equal to "UBERON:0002048".
(4) Retrieve the Disease Ontology IDs for cancer tissues from the table "cancer_tissue", excluding those with a Uberon anatomical ID of "UBERON:0002048".
(5) What is the disease ontology ID for cancer tissues, excluding those with the anatomical identifier UBERON:0002048?
(6) "Retrieve the disease ontology identifier from cancer tissue where the corresponding anatomical identifier is not equal to UBERON:0002048."
(7) "Retrieve the Disease Ontology ID from the cancer_tissue table where the Uberon anatomical ID is not equal to 'UBERON:0002048'."
