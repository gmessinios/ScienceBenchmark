Original Query:
SELECT T1.uberon_anatomical_id FROM disease_mutation_tissue AS T1 JOIN disease_mutation AS T2 ON T1.disease_mutation_id = T2.id WHERE T2.peptide_pos != 211
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the anatomical IDs from disease mutation tissues for which the peptide position of its associated disease mutation is not equal to 211.
(1) Retrieve the anatomical ID from the disease mutation tissue table for all disease mutations that have a peptide position different from 211 in the corresponding entry in the disease mutation table.
(2) Get the anatomical ID from the disease_mutation_tissue table where the disease_mutation_id is equal to id in the disease_mutation table and the peptide_pos is not 211.
(3) Retrieve the uberon anatomical IDs from the disease mutation tissues for all disease mutations that have a peptide position other than 211.
(4) Find the uberon anatomical id of the disease mutation tissue that is associated with a disease mutation where the peptide position is not equal to 211.
(5) Find the anatomical ID from the tissue associated with disease mutations that do not occur at position 211 in the peptide.
(6) Find the uberon anatomical IDs for all diseases and mutations where the peptide position is not equal to 211.
(7) Find the uberon anatomical ID from the disease_mutation_tissue table for all disease mutations where the peptide position is not equal to 211.
