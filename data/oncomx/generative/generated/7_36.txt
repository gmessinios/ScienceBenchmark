Original Query:
SELECT T1.adjpvalue FROM differential_expression AS T1 WHERE T1.subjects_up = 6 or T1.pvalue = 1.42e-134
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the adjusted p-value from the differential expression table for subjects with six upregulated genes or a p-value of 1.42e-134.
(1) Retrieve the adjusted p-value from the differential expression table for all rows where either the number of subjects up is equal to 6 or the p-value is equal to 1.42e-134.
(2) Retrieve the adjusted p-value from the differential_expression table where either the number of subjects up is equal to 6 or the p-value is equal to 1.42e-134.
(3) Find the adjusted p-value from the table of differential expression where either the number of subjects up is 6 or the p-value is equal to 1.42e-134.
(4) Find the adjusted p-values from the differential_expression table for subjects with 6 upregulated genes or a p-value of 1.42e-134.
(5) Retrieve the adjusted p-value from the table "differential_expression" for all rows where the number of subjects in the "subjects_up" column is equal to 6 or the p-value in the "pvalue" column is equal to 1.42e-134.
(6) What is the adjusted p-value for differential expression data where the number of subjects in the up-regulated group is 6 or the unadjusted p-value is equal to 1.42e-134?
(7) "Retrieve the adjusted p-values from the differential_expression table where the subjects_up column is equal to 6 or the p-value is equal to 1.42e-134."
