###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.peptide_pos FROM disease_mutation AS T1    ORDER BY T1.id DESC LIMIT 1
GPT-3 choices:
(0) What is the position of the peptide in the most recent entry in the disease_mutation table?
(1) Retrieve the position of the peptide in the latest entry in the disease_mutation table, sorted in descending order by its id and limited to only one result.
(2) Retrieve the position of the peptide from the most recent disease mutation in descending order.
(3) "Retrieve the peptide position from the latest entry in the disease mutation table, ordered by descending ID and limited to one result."
(4) Retrieve the position of the peptide from the last entry in the table "disease_mutation" when sorted by descending ID.
(5) What is the position of the last peptide in the table of disease mutations ordered by ID?
(6) Retrieve the peptide position from the most recently added entry in the disease_mutation table, ordered by descending ID.
(7) Get the position of the peptide from the last entry in the table of disease mutations, ordered by descending id.
