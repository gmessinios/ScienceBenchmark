###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.alt_aa FROM disease_mutation AS T1 WHERE T1.aa_pos_uniprotkb = 311 or T1.id = 12501
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the alternate amino acid for a mutation in the disease mutation database where the amino acid position is 311 or the id is 12501.
(1) What is the alternate amino acid for a mutation at position 311 or with an ID of 12501 in the disease_mutation table?
(2) Retrieve the alternative amino acid at position 311 or the mutation with ID 12501 from the disease_mutation table.
(3) What are the alternate amino acids associated with a disease mutation at position 311 in the UniprotKB database, or with an ID of 12501?
(4) Retrieve the alternative amino acid at position 311 or the mutation with an id of 12501 from the disease_mutation table.
(5) What is the alternative amino acid for a disease mutation at position 311 in UniProtKB or with an ID of 12501?
(6) Retrieve the alternative amino acid found in disease mutations where the position on the UniProtKB sequence is 311 or the mutation ID is 12501.
(7) What is the alternative amino acid for the mutation in disease_mutation where the amino acid position in UniProtKB is 311 or the ID is 12501?
