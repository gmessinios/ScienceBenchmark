Original Query:
SELECT T1.biomarker_fda_id FROM biomarker_fda_drug AS T1 JOIN biomarker_fda AS T2 ON T1.biomarker_fda_id = T2.id WHERE T2.test_submission != "P190004"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the ID of biomarker-FDA-drugs from the biomarker-FDA table, where the test submission is not equal to "P190004".
(1) Get the biomarker FDA IDs from the table biomarker_fda_drug, where the test_submission column in the table biomarker_fda is not equal to "P190004".
(2) "Retrieve the biomarker FDA IDs from the biomarker FDA drug table where the associated test submission in the biomarker FDA table is not equal to "P190004".
(3) Get the FDA biomarker ID from the biomarker_fda_drug table where the corresponding test_submission value in the biomarker_fda table is not equal to "P190004".
(4) Retrieve the ID of biomarkers from the FDA that have not been submitted for test "P190004" in the table "biomarker_fda_drug".
(5) Find the biomarker FDA IDs for drugs that are not part of test submission "P190004" in the table "biomarker_fda_drug", joined with the table "biomarker_fda".
(6) "Find the FDA biomarker IDs from the table of FDA biomarker-drug associations where the corresponding biomarker has not been submitted for test under the code "P190004".
(7) Find the biomarker FDA IDs for all biomarkers that are not part of a test submission with the code "P190004".
