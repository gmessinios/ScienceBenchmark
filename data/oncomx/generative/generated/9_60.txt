Original Query:
SELECT T1.speciesid FROM species AS T1 JOIN xref_gene_ensembl AS T2 ON T1.speciesid = T2.speciesid WHERE T2.gene_symbol != "1700040K01Rik"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Which species have a speciesid that is also found in the xref_gene_ensembl table and where the corresponding gene_symbol is not equal to "1700040K01Rik"?
(1) Find the species id for all species that have an entry in the xref_gene_ensembl table, where the gene symbol is not equal to "1700040K01Rik".
(2) Retrieve the species ID from the Species table where the gene symbol in the Xref Gene Ensembl table is not "1700040K01Rik" and there is a match between their species IDs.
(3) Find the species ID for all species where the gene symbol is not equal to "1700040K01Rik" in the xref_gene_ensembl table.
(4) Retrieve the species IDs from the "species" table where the gene symbol in the "xref_gene_ensembl" table is not equal to "1700040K01Rik", joined by matching species IDs between the two tables.
(5) What is the speciesid for all species where the gene symbol is not "1700040K01Rik" in the xref_gene_ensembl table?
(6) Retrieve the species ID from the table "species" where there is a match with the table "xref_gene_ensembl" on the species ID and exclude any rows where the gene symbol is not equal to "1700040K01Rik".
(7) Retrieve the species ID from the species table, where the gene symbol in the xref_gene_ensembl table is not equal to "1700040K01Rik".
