SELECT disease_mutation_tissue.uberon_anatomical_id FROM disease_mutation_tissue AS disease_mutation_tissue JOIN disease_mutation AS disease_mutation ON disease_mutation_tissue.disease_mutation_id = disease_mutation.id WHERE disease_mutation.ref_aa != "K"

Original Query:
SELECT T1.uberon_anatomical_id FROM disease_mutation_tissue AS T1 JOIN disease_mutation AS T2 ON T1.disease_mutation_id = T2.id WHERE T2.ref_aa != "K"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the uberon anatomical ID for tissues associated with disease mutations where the reference amino acid is not "K".
(1) Retrieve the uberon anatomical ID from the disease_mutation_tissue table where the corresponding disease_mutation does not have a reference amino acid of "K".
(2) Retrieve the unique anatomical identifier from disease_mutation_tissue where the reference amino acid is not "K" in the corresponding disease_mutation.
(3) Retrieve the anatomical IDs from the disease mutation tissue table for all diseases and mutations where the reference amino acid is not equal to "K".
(4) Retrieve the unique anatomical IDs from disease mutation tissues for all diseases and mutations where the reference amino acid is not "K".
(5) Retrieve the uberon anatomical IDs from the disease mutation tissues that are associated with disease mutations where the reference amino acid is not equal to "K".
(6) Get the anatomical ID from disease mutation tissues for all disease mutations that have a reference amino acid other than "K".
(7) Find the anatomical IDs from disease mutation tissue where the reference amino acid in disease mutation is not equal to "K".
