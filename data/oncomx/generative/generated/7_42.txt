###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.phase FROM biomarker_edrn AS T1 WHERE T1.biomarker_type = "Genetic" or T1.qa_state = "Curated"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the phase of all biomarkers from the EDRN database that are either of type "Genetic" or have a QA state of "Curated".
(1) Find the phase of all biomarkers from the EDRN database that are either of type "Genetic" or have a QA state of "Curated".
(2) Retrieve the phase of biomarkers that are either of type "Genetic" or have a QA state of "Curated" from the table biomarker_edrn.
(3) "Retrieve the phase information from biomarker_edrn where the biomarker type is Genetic or the quality assurance state is Curated."
(4) What is the phase of biomarkers in the EDRN database that are either of type "Genetic" or have a QA state of "Curated"?
(5) Retrieve the phase of all curated biomarkers that are either of type "Genetic" or have a QA state of "Curated".
(6) Retrieve the phase of biomarkers from the EDRN database where the biomarker type is genetic or the quality assurance state is curated.
(7) Find the phase of all biomarkers in the EDRN database that are either genetic or have been curated.
