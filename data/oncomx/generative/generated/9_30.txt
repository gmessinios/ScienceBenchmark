Original Query:
SELECT T1.description FROM disease_mutation_site_annotation AS T1 JOIN disease_mutation AS T2 ON T1.disease_mutation_id = T2.id WHERE T2.data_source != "cosmic"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the descriptions from disease mutation site annotations for all disease mutations that are not from the data source "cosmic".
(1) Retrieve the description of disease mutation site annotations for all disease mutations that are not from the data source "cosmic".
(2) Retrieve the description of all disease mutation sites from the disease_mutation_site_annotation table where the data source is not "cosmic".
(3) Get the description from the disease_mutation_site_annotation table where the data_source in the disease_mutation table is not "cosmic".
(4) Retrieve the description from the disease mutation site annotation table where the data source for the associated disease mutation is not "cosmic".
(5) Retrieve the description of the disease mutation sites from the annotations table for all disease mutations except those from the data source "cosmic".
(6) Get the description of disease mutation sites from the database for all disease mutations except those from COSMIC as stored in the tables "disease_mutation_site_annotation" and "disease_mutation".
(7) Retrieve the description from the disease mutation site annotations table for all disease mutations that are not from the data source "cosmic".
