Original Query:

GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the anatomical entity IDs from the table disease_mutation_tissue, excluding "UBERON:0002298", by joining it with the anatomical_entity table.
(1) Get the unique Uberon anatomical IDs from the disease_mutation_tissue table where the ID is not "UBERON:0002298", by joining it with the anatomical_entity table.
(2) Retrieve the UBERON anatomical IDs from disease-mutation-tissue where the corresponding anatomical entities are not equal to "UBERON:0002298".
(3) "Retrieve the Uberon anatomical identifier for all disease-mutation-tissue associations, excluding those with the UBERON:0002298 anatomical entity."
(4) Find the Uberon anatomical IDs from the disease_mutation_tissue table, excluding those that are equal to "UBERON:0002298", by joining it with the anatomical_entity table.
(5) Retrieve the uberon anatomical ID from the disease_mutation_tissue table for all entries except those with an id of "UBERON:0002298", by joining it with the anatomical_entity table.
(6) Retrieve the Uberon anatomical IDs from the table "disease_mutation_tissue" that correspond to anatomical entities in the table "anatomical_entity", excluding those with ID "UBERON:0002298".
(7) Get the UBERON anatomical IDs from the disease_mutation_tissue table, excluding the ID for "UBERON:0002298", by joining it with the anatomical_entity table and comparing their IDs.
