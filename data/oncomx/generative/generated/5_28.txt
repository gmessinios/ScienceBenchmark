Original Query:
SELECT T1.tool FROM disease_mutation_impact_prediction AS T1    ORDER BY T1.disease_mutation_id DESC LIMIT 1
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Get the tool used for predicting the impact of a disease mutation from the most recent entry in the disease_mutation_impact_prediction table.
(1) Get the tool used for the latest disease mutation impact prediction.
(2) Retrieve the tool used for predicting the impact of disease mutations, ordered by the most recent disease mutation ID and limited to one result.
(3) Get the tool used for the most recent disease mutation impact prediction in the table.
(4) What is the tool used for predicting the impact of a disease mutation in the last row of the table 'disease_mutation_impact_prediction'?
(5) Get the tool used for predicting the impact of mutations in diseases from the most recent entry in the "disease_mutation_impact_prediction" table.
(6) Get the tool used in predicting the impact of a disease mutation by selecting it from the "disease_mutation_impact_prediction" table, ordering it based on the disease_mutation_id in descending order, and limiting the result to one row.
(7) Get the tool used for predicting the impact of a disease mutation from the table "disease_mutation_impact_prediction", sorted in descending order by the column "disease_mutation_id" and returning only the top result.
