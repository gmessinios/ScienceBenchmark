###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.biomarker_description FROM biomarker AS T1 JOIN biomarker_fda AS T2 ON T1.id = T2.id WHERE T2.test_trade_name != "Cologuard"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the descriptions of biomarkers that are not associated with the test trade name "Cologuard".
(1) What is the description of biomarkers that are not associated with the test trade name "Cologuard" in the FDA database?
(2) Retrieve the biomarker description from the biomarker table, joining it with the biomarker_fda table and excluding any entries where the test_trade_name column is equal to "Cologuard".
(3) Find the description of biomarkers that are not included in a test with the trade name "Cologuard".
(4) What is the description of all biomarkers that do not have a test trade name of "Cologuard"?
(5) What are the biomarker descriptions for all biomarkers except "Cologuard" from the biomarker and biomarker_fda tables?
(6) Find the description of biomarkers from the table "biomarker" that do not have the trade name "Cologuard" in the table "biomarker_fda".
(7) Retrieve the description of all biomarkers that have been approved by the FDA but are not associated with the test trade name "Cologuard".
