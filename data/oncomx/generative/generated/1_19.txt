Original Query:
SELECT T1.speciesid FROM xref_gene_ensembl AS T1 JOIN healthy_expression AS T2 ON T1.ensembl_gene_id = T2.ensembl_gene_id WHERE T2.expression_level_anatomical_relative = "LOW"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the species ID from the xref_gene_ensembl table for genes that have a low expression level in the healthy_expression table.
(1) Find the species ID for genes that are listed in both the xref_gene_ensembl and healthy_expression tables, where the expression level in healthy tissues is classified as "LOW".
(2) Retrieve the species ID from the xref_gene_ensembl table for all genes that have a low relative expression level in the healthy_expression table.
(3) Retrieve the species ID from the xref_gene_ensembl table for genes in the healthy_expression table that have a low relative expression level.
(4) Retrieve the species ID from the xref_gene_ensembl table for all genes in the healthy_expression table that have a low relative expression level.
(5) Retrieve the species IDs from the xref_gene_ensembl table for genes that have a low relative expression level in the healthy_expression table.
(6) Retrieve the species IDs from the xref_gene_ensembl table for all genes in the healthy_expression table with a LOW relative expression level.
(7) What is the species ID for genes that are listed in both the xref_gene_ensembl table and the healthy_expression table, where the expression level is classified as "LOW" relative to a particular anatomical structure?
