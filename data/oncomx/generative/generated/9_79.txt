Original Query:
SELECT T1.speciesid FROM xref_gene_ensembl AS T1 JOIN healthy_expression AS T2 ON T1.ensembl_gene_id = T2.ensembl_gene_id WHERE T2.expression_score != 72.20000
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the species ID from the xref_gene_ensembl table where the ensembl_gene_id matches with the one in healthy_expression table and expression_score is not equal to 72.20000.
(1) Retrieve the species ID from the xref_gene_ensembl table where the ensembl_gene_id matches between xref_gene_ensembl and healthy_expression, and where the expression_score in healthy_expression is not equal to 72.20000.
(2) Find the speciesid from the xref_gene_ensembl table where the ensembl_gene_id matches between xref_gene_ensembl and healthy_expression, but only return results where the expression_score is not equal to 72.20000 in the healthy_expression table.
(3) Find the species IDs from the xref_gene_ensembl table for which there are expression scores that are not equal to 72.20000 in the healthy_expression table, where the ensembl_gene_id matches between the two tables.
(4) Get the species IDs from the xref_gene_ensembl table for genes that have a corresponding expression score in the healthy_expression table that is not equal to 72.20000.
(5) Retrieve the species ID from the xref_gene_ensembl table for all genes where their expression score in the healthy_expression table is not equal to 72.20000.
(6) Get the speciesid from the xref_gene_ensembl table for all genes that have an ensembl_gene_id that is present in both the xref_gene_ensembl and healthy_expression tables, where the expression_score in healthy_expression is not equal to 72.20000.
(7) Find the speciesid from xref_gene_ensembl where the ensembl_gene_id matches with healthy_expression and the expression_score is not equal to 72.20000.
