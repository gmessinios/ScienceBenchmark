###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.id FROM disease AS T1 JOIN differential_expression AS T2 ON T1.id = T2.doid WHERE T2.log2fc != 0.4
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the disease IDs that have corresponding differential expression DOIDs where the log2 fold change is not equal to 0.4.
(1) Retrieve the ID of all diseases that have differential expression information where the log2fc value is not equal to 0.4.
(2) "Find the IDs of all diseases that have corresponding differential expression data with a log2 fold change different from 0.4."
(3) Find the IDs of all diseases that have been mentioned in a differential expression where the log2fc value is not equal to 0.4.
(4) Retrieve the ID of diseases that have associated differential expression values with a log2 fold change not equal to 0.4.
(5) Find the disease IDs from the disease table that have corresponding differential expression DOIDs where the log2fc value is not equal to 0.4 in the differential_expression table.
(6) Retrieve the ID of all diseases from the disease table that have an entry in the differential_expression table with a log2fc value not equal to 0.4.
(7) Retrieve the ID of all diseases that have at least one differential expression entry with a log2 fold change value not equal to 0.4.
