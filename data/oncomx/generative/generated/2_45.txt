###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.biomarker_type, count(*) FROM biomarker_edrn AS T1  GROUP BY T1.biomarker_type
GPT-3 choices:
(0) How many biomarker types are there in the biomarker_edrn table and what is the count for each type?
(1) "How many biomarkers are there for each biomarker type in the EDRN database?"
(2) How many biomarkers of each type are there in the biomarker_edrn table?
(3) What is the count of each type of biomarker in the biomarker_edrn table?
(4) What is the number of biomarkers grouped by their type in the table called "biomarker_edrn" in the database named "biomarker_edrn"?
(5) How many biomarkers are there for each type in the database?
(6) Count the number of biomarkers for each biomarker type in the biomarker_edrn table.
(7) "How many biomarkers are there for each type in the database?"
