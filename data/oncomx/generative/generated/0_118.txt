Original Query:
SELECT T1.expression_level_gene_relative FROM healthy_expression AS T1 WHERE T1.uberon_developmental_id = "MmusDv:0000047"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the relative expression level of genes from healthy tissues where the developmental stage is "postnatal" in mouse.
(1) Retrieve the relative expression levels of genes in healthy individuals for developmental stage MmusDv:0000047 from the healthy_expression table.
(2) Get the expression level gene relative from the table of healthy_expression where the uberon_developmental_id is "MmusDv:0000047".
(3) Get the relative expression levels of genes from the healthy_expression table for all entries with a uberon_developmental_id of "MmusDv:0000047".
(4) Retrieve the relative expression level of genes from healthy tissue in the developmental stage corresponding to MmusDv:0000047.
(5) Retrieve the relative gene expression levels from healthy tissue in mice at the developmental stage specified by "MmusDv:0000047".
(6) Retrieve the expression levels of genes in healthy organisms relative to their developmental stage as specified by the ID "MmusDv:0000047" from the table "healthy_expression".
(7) Get the expression level relative to the gene from the healthy_expression table for all entries with the uberon_developmental_id "MmusDv:0000047".
