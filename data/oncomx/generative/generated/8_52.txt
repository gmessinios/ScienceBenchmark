SELECT biomarker_fda_test_use.id FROM biomarker_fda_test_use AS biomarker_fda_test_use WHERE biomarker_fda_test_use.approved_indication != "prediction"

###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.id FROM biomarker_fda_test_use AS T1 WHERE T1.approved_indication != "prediction"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the IDs of biomarkers that have been tested by the FDA for use in indications other than prediction.
(1) Find the IDs from biomarker_fda_test_use where the approved_indication is not "prediction".
(2) Retrieve the ID of biomarkers from the FDA test use table where the approved indication is not "prediction".
(3) Retrieve the IDs of biomarkers from the FDA test use table where the approved indication is not "prediction".
(4) Find the id from the table biomarker_fda_test_use where the approved indication is not equal to "prediction".
(5) Retrieve the IDs from the biomarker_fda_test_use table where the approved_indication column does not equal "prediction".
(6) Find the IDs from biomarker_fda_test_use where the approved indication is not "prediction".
(7) Find the IDs of biomarker FDA tests that have an approved indication other than prediction.
