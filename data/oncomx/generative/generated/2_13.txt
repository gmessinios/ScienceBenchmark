Original Query:
SELECT T1.ensembl_transcript_id, count(*) FROM map_protein_disease_mutation AS T1  GROUP BY T1.ensembl_transcript_id
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the number of occurrences for each ensembl transcript ID in the table "map_protein_disease_mutation".
(1) "Count the number of occurrences in the table "map_protein_disease_mutation" for each unique ensembl_transcript_id and group the results by ensembl_transcript_id."
(2) Count the number of mutations for each transcript in the map_protein_disease_mutation table and group them by their ensembl_transcript_id.
(3) Count the number of occurrences for each Ensembl transcript ID in the "map_protein_disease_mutation" table.
(4) Retrieve the count of how many times a mutation is associated with a specific Ensembl transcript ID from the map_protein_disease_mutation table, grouped by each unique Ensembl transcript ID.
(5) Count the number of occurrences for each ensembl transcript ID in the table map_protein_disease_mutation and group them by ensembl transcript ID.
(6) "Count the number of mutations associated with each unique Ensembl transcript ID from the map_protein_disease_mutation table."
(7) Retrieve the number of occurrences for each unique ensembl transcript ID from the map_protein_disease_mutation table.
