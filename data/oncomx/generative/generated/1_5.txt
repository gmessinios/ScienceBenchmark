GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the disease mutation ID from the tissue and anatomical entity tables where the anatomical entity description is an organ that facilitates metabolic exchange between a fetus and mother, composed of both embryonic and maternal components, with the fetal portion referred to as villous chorion and the maternal portion known as decidua basalis, connected by anchoring villi attached to decidua basalis by cytotrophoblastic shell.
(1) Find the disease mutation IDs associated with a specific organ of metabolic interchange between fetus and mother, known as the placenta, which is made up of two parts - the villous chorion and decidua basalis - held together by anchoring villi anchored to the maternal portion called cytotrophoblastic shell.
(2) Find the disease and mutation IDs for all cases where an organ that serves as a point of metabolic exchange between fetus and mother, comprised of both embryonic and maternal origins, is involved in a disease-mutation-tissue relationship.
(3) Find the disease-mutation IDs that are associated with an anatomical entity described as "organ of metabolic interchange between fetus and mother, partly of embryonic origin and partly of maternal origin", where the fetal portion is known as the villous chorion and the maternal portion is known as the decidua basalis, and both portions are held together by anchoring villi anchored to the decidua basalis by a cytotrophoblastic shell.
(4) Find all disease-mutation-tissue IDs where the corresponding anatomical entity is an organ that acts as a site for metabolic exchange between a fetus and its mother, composed of both embryonic and maternal tissue, consisting of the fetal villous chorion and the maternal decidua basalis held together by anchoring villi.
(5) Find the disease mutation IDs from the placenta where it is an organ that allows metabolic exchange between the fetus and mother, with a fetal portion known as villous chorion and a maternal portion known as decidua basalis, and are held together by anchoring villi anchored to the decidua basalis by the cytotrophoblastic shell.
(6) Get the disease mutation ID from the disease_mutation_tissue table by joining it with the anatomical_entity table on uberon_anatomical_id where the anatomical_entity description is "organ of metabolic interchange between fetus and mother, partly of embryonic origin and partly of maternal origin[GO]" and get the fetal portion of the placenta known as villous chorion joined with the maternal portion known as decidua basalis through anchoring villi anchored to cytotrophoblastic shell in
(7) Retrieve the disease-mutation ID from the table "disease_mutation_tissue" where the description of the anatomical entity in the table "anatomical_entity" is "organ of metabolic interchange between fetus and mother, partly of embryonic origin and partly of maternal origin", with a fetal portion known as villous chorion and a maternal portion known as decidua basalis, connected by anchoring villi anchored to decidua basalis by cytotrophoblastic shell.
