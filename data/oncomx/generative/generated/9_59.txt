GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the IDs of anatomical entities that are connected to disease mutation tissues and are not equal to "UBERON:0001825".
(1) Find all anatomical entities that have an id in the disease_mutation_tissue table and are not equal to "UBERON:0001825".
(2) Find the ID of all anatomical entities that are associated with disease-mutation-tissue entries, except for the one with the ID "UBERON:0001825".
(3) Retrieve the identifiers of anatomical entities that are associated with mutations in diseases and are not equal to "UBERON:0001825".
(4) What are the IDs of all anatomical entities that are not equal to "UBERON:0001825" in the disease_mutation_tissue table?
(5) Find all anatomical entities that have an ID in the disease_mutation_tissue table and are not equal to "UBERON:0001825".
(6) Find all anatomical entities that have an ID in the disease_mutation_tissue table where the UBERON anatomical ID is not equal to "UBERON:0001825".
(7) Retrieve the ID of anatomical entities from the disease_mutation_tissue table where the ID does not equal "UBERON:0001825" and is also found in the anatomical_entity table.
