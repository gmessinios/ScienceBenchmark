Original Query:
SELECT T1.expression_level_gene_relative FROM healthy_expression AS T1 JOIN xref_gene_ensembl AS T2 ON T1.ensembl_gene_id = T2.ensembl_gene_id WHERE T2.gene_symbol != "2410021H03Rik"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the relative expression levels of genes in healthy tissue, excluding the gene with a symbol "2410021H03Rik", from the table "healthy_expression" by joining it with the table "xref_gene_ensembl" using their shared Ensembl gene IDs.
(1) Get the relative expression levels of genes from healthy individuals, excluding the gene with the symbol "2410021H03Rik".
(2) Retrieve the relative expression levels for all healthy genes, excluding "2410021H03Rik", by joining the tables healthy_expression and xref_gene_ensembl and selecting the expression_level_gene_relative column from healthy_expression for genes with an ensembl gene ID that is not equal to "2410021H03Rik" in xref_gene_ensembl.
(3) Retrieve the relative expression level of all genes from the healthy_expression table, excluding the gene with the symbol "2410021H03Rik", by joining it with the xref_gene_ensembl table using their common ensembl_gene_id column.
(4) Retrieve the expression level gene relative from the healthy_expression table for all genes in xref_gene_ensembl except for "2410021H03Rik".
(5) Get the relative expression level for genes in healthy tissue, excluding the gene "2410021H03Rik", by joining the healthy_expression and xref_gene_ensembl tables and selecting only rows where the gene symbol is not equal to "2410021H03Rik".
(6) Get the expression level relative to the gene of all healthy expressions except for 2410021H03Rik, using the data from xref_gene_ensembl and healthy_expression.
(7) Retrieve the relative expression level of genes from the healthy_expression table, excluding the gene with the symbol "2410021H03Rik", by joining it with the xref_gene_ensembl table on matching Ensembl gene IDs.
