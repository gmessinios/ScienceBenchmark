Original Query:
SELECT T1.disease_mutation_id FROM disease_mutation_impact_prediction AS T1    ORDER BY T1.probability DESC LIMIT 1
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Get the disease mutation ID with the highest probability from the table of disease mutation impact predictions, ordered in descending order and limited to one result.
(1) Find the disease mutation ID with the highest probability of impact in descending order from the disease_mutation_impact_prediction table.
(2) Find the disease mutation ID from the disease_mutation_impact_prediction table where the probability is highest, and order it in descending order with a limit of one result.
(3) What is the disease mutation ID with the highest probability from the table "disease_mutation_impact_prediction"?
(4) What is the highest probability disease mutation impact prediction and its corresponding ID in the table "disease_mutation_impact_prediction"?
(5) "Find the disease mutation id with the highest probability from the disease_mutation_impact_prediction table, ordered in descending order and limited to one result."
(6) What is the disease mutation ID with the highest probability in the disease_mutation_impact_prediction table?
(7) Find the disease mutation with the highest probability in the impact prediction table, ordered by probability in descending order, and limit the result to one row.
