Original Query:
SELECT T1.peptide_id FROM map_protein_disease_mutation AS T1 JOIN disease_mutation AS T2 ON T1.ensembl_transcript_id = T2.ensembl_transcript_id WHERE T2.alt_nt = "T"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the peptide IDs from the map of protein-disease-mutation where the alternate nucleotide is "T" for transcripts with matching ensembl transcript IDs in both the map and disease_mutation tables.
(1) Find the peptide ids from the map_protein_disease_mutation table where the disease mutation's alternate nucleotide is "T" and it matches with the ensembl transcript id in both tables.
(2) What are the peptide IDs for mutations that have a thymine nucleotide variant in the disease_mutation table, joined with the ensembl_transcript_id column from the map_protein_disease_mutation table?
(3) "Retrieve the peptide IDs from the map_protein_disease_mutation table for all entries where the alternate nucleotide in disease_mutation is "T"."
(4) Retrieve the peptide IDs from the map_protein_disease_mutation table where the alternative nucleotide in the corresponding disease_mutation entry is "T".
(5) Retrieve the peptide ID from the map of protein-disease mutations for those that have an alternative nucleotide "T" in their associated disease mutation.
(6) "Retrieve the peptide IDs from the map_protein_disease_mutation table where the ensembl_transcript_id matches with that of disease_mutation and the alt_nt value is 'T'."
(7) Retrieve the peptide IDs from the map_protein_disease_mutation table for mutations in diseases where the alternate nucleotide is "T".
