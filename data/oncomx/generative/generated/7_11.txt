Original Query:
SELECT T1.subjects_nochange FROM differential_expression AS T1 WHERE T1.log2fc = -8.55 or T1.subjects_up = 27
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the number of subjects with no change in gene expression from the table "differential_expression" where the log2 fold change is equal to -8.55 or the number of subjects with upregulated gene expression is equal to 27.
(1) Retrieve the number of subjects that had no change in differential expression or were up-regulated by 27 and have a log2 fold change of -8.55 from the differential expression table.
(2) Retrieve the subjects_nochange column from the differential_expression table where the log2fc column is equal to -8.55 or the subjects_up column is equal to 27.
(3) Retrieve the number of subjects that did not change or had an up-regulation of 27 for a differential expression with a log2 fold change of -8.55 from the table named "differential_expression".
(4) Retrieve the number of subjects whose expression did not change or increased by 27 when the log fold change is equal to -8.55 from the differential_expression table.
(5) Get the number of subjects with no change in expression or an increase in expression by 27 from the table of differential expression where the log2 fold change is equal to -8.55.
(6) Retrieve the number of subjects with no change in gene expression from the table "differential_expression" where the log2 fold change is -8.55 or the number of subjects with an increase in gene expression is 27.
(7) Retrieve the number of subjects who did not have any changes in expression, where the log2 fold change is -8.55 or the number of subjects with up-regulated expression is 27, from the table "differential_expression".
