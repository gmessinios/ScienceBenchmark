###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.cds_pos FROM disease_mutation AS T1    ORDER BY T1.mutation_freq DESC LIMIT 1
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Get the coding sequence position from the disease_mutation table, order it in descending order by the mutation frequency column, and limit the result to 1 record.
(1) Retrieve the coding sequence position of the most frequently occurring mutation in the disease_mutation table, sorted in descending order, with a limit of one result.
(2) "Retrieve the coding sequence position from the disease mutation table, sorted in descending order by mutation frequency and limited to only the highest frequency mutation."
(3) Get the coding sequence position from the disease_mutation table, order it by mutation frequency in descending order, and only return the top result.
(4) "Retrieve the position of the coding sequence for disease mutations in descending order based on their mutation frequency, limited to only the highest frequency result."
(5) "Find the position of the coding sequence for disease mutations in ascending order, limited to the highest frequency mutation."
(6) Retrieve the coding sequence position from the disease_mutation table and order them in descending order based on their mutation frequency, then select only the top result.
(7) Retrieve the coding sequence position from the table "disease_mutation" in descending order by the frequency of mutations and limit the results to only one row.
