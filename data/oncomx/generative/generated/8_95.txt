###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.subjects_nochange FROM differential_expression AS T1 WHERE T1.doid != 1324
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the number of subjects from the table "differential_expression" where the disease ID is not equal to 1324.
(1) Find the number of subjects with no change in differential expression except for those with the disease DOID 1324.
(2) What is the number of subjects without changes in differential expression for all diseases except melanoma?
(3) Get the number of subjects from the differential expression table where the disease ID is not equal to 1324.
(4) Find the number of subjects who did not experience any changes in differential expression from the table differential_expression, excluding those with a doid value of 1324.
(5) Retrieve the subjects who did not experience any changes in gene expression, from the differential expression table, where the disease ontology ID is not equal to 1324.
(6) Find the number of subjects who did not experience any change in differential expression, excluding those with a disease ID of 1324.
(7) Retrieve the number of subjects with no changes in differential expression from the table "differential_expression" excluding entries where the DOID is equal to 1324.
