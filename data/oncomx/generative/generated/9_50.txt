###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.id FROM disease AS T1 JOIN differential_expression AS T2 ON T1.id = T2.doid WHERE T2.adjpvalue != 7.78e-148
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the id of diseases that have a corresponding record in the differential_expression table with an adjpvalue that is not equal to 7.78e-14.
(1) What is the disease ID from the disease table that is associated with a differential expression value not equal to 7.78e-14?
(2) Get the ID of any diseases that have a corresponding differential expression with an adjusted p-value other than 7.78e-14.
(3) Find the IDs of all diseases that have a differential expression value associated with them that is not equal to 7.78e-14.
(4) Find the ID of all diseases that have differential expression data with an adjusted p-value not equal to 7.78e-14.
(5) What are the IDs of diseases that have an adjusted p-value not equal to 7.78e-14 in the differential expression table?
(6) Find the disease ID for all diseases that have a corresponding differential expression with an adjusted p-value other than 7.78e-148.
(7) Find the IDs of diseases that are associated with differential expression data, where the adjusted p-value is not equal to 7.78e-14.
