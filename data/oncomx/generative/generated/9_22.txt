SELECT biomarker_fda_drug.biomarker_drug FROM biomarker_fda_drug AS biomarker_fda_drug JOIN biomarker_fda AS biomarker_fda ON biomarker_fda_drug.biomarker_fda_id = biomarker_fda.id WHERE biomarker_fda.id != "FDA000143"

###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.biomarker_drug FROM biomarker_fda_drug AS T1 JOIN biomarker_fda AS T2 ON T1.biomarker_fda_id = T2.id WHERE T2.id != "FDA000143"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Get all of the FDA-approved drugs associated with biomarkers, excluding the biomarker with ID "FDA000143".
(1) Find all FDA approved drugs associated with biomarkers, excluding the one with ID "FDA000143".
(2) What biomarker drugs have been associated with FDA-approved biomarkers, excluding those with the ID "FDA000143"?
(3) Get the names of all biomarker drugs from the biomarker_fda_drug table where the associated biomarker fda id is not "FDA000143".
(4) What are the biomarker drugs associated with FDA biomarkers, excluding FDA000143?
(5) Retrieve the biomarker-drug associations for all drugs that have not been assigned the ID "FDA000143" in the FDA biomarker database.
(6) Find all the biomarker drugs associated with FDA biomarkers except for the one with ID "FDA000143".
(7) Get the list of biomarker drugs from the biomarker FDA drug table, excluding those that have the ID "FDA000143", by joining it with the biomarker FDA table.
