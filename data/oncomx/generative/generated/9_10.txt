Original Query:
SELECT T1.test_submission FROM biomarker_fda AS T1 JOIN biomarker_fda_test AS T2 ON T1.test_trade_name = T2.test_trade_name WHERE T2.histological_type != "8500/2 (ductal carcinoma in situ) OR 8520/2 (lobular carcinoma in situ)"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the test submission for FDA approved biomarkers that are not histologically classified as ductal or lobular carcinoma in situ.
(1) Find all test submissions from the biomarker_fda table where the corresponding histological type in the biomarker_fda_test table is not "ductal carcinoma in situ" or "lobular carcinoma in situ".
(2) Find all test submissions from the FDA database for biomarkers that have a histological type that is not 8500/2 (ductal carcinoma in situ) or 8520/2 (lobular carcinoma in situ).
(3) Retrieve the test submissions from the FDA biomarker database where the histological type is not ductal carcinoma in situ or lobular carcinoma in situ.
(4) Retrieve all test submissions from the FDA biomarker database for which the associated histological type is not 8500/2 or 8520/2 (ductal carcinoma in situ or lobular carcinoma in situ), using data from both the biomarker_fda and biomarker_fda_test tables.
(5) Show me the test submissions from biomarker_fda where the histological type is not 8500/2 (ductal carcinoma in situ) or 8520/2 (lobular carcinoma in situ), joining with biomarker_fda_test on test_trade_name.
(6) Retrieve the test submissions from the FDA biomarker database where the histological type is not ductal carcinoma in situ or lobular carcinoma in situ.
(7) Retrieve the test submission from the FDA biomarker database for all tests listed in both the biomarker_fda and biomarker_fda_test tables, where the histological type is not equal to either "ductal carcinoma in situ" or "lobular carcinoma in situ".
