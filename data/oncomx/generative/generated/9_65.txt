Original Query:
SELECT T1.probability FROM disease_mutation_impact_prediction AS T1 JOIN disease_mutation AS T2 ON T1.disease_mutation_id = T2.id WHERE T2.aa_pos_uniprotkb != 488
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the probability of disease mutation impact prediction for all records in the disease_mutation_impact_prediction table, where the corresponding record in the disease_mutation table has an aa_pos_uniprotkb value that is not equal to 488.
(1) What is the probability of disease mutation impact prediction for all records in which the amino acid position in UniprotKB is not equal to 488?
(2) What is the probability of disease mutation impact prediction for all disease mutations with an amino acid position in UniprotKB that is not equal to 488?
(3) Retrieve the probability values from the disease_mutation_impact_prediction table for all disease-mutation pairs where the amino acid position in the disease_mutation table is not equal to 488.
(4) Find the probability of disease mutation impact prediction for all entries where the amino acid position in UniprotKB is not equal to 488.
(5) What is the probability of disease mutation impact prediction for disease mutations that do not have an amino acid position on the UniProtKB database of 488?
(6) Retrieve the probability of disease mutation impact prediction for all entries where the amino acid position in UniprotKB is not 488.
(7) Find the probability of impact prediction for disease mutations where the amino acid position in UniprotKB is not 488.
