Original Query:
SELECT T1.uberon_anatomical_id FROM disease_mutation_tissue AS T1 JOIN disease_mutation AS T2 ON T1.disease_mutation_id = T2.id WHERE T2.aa_pos_uniprotkb != 715
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the anatomical ID of all tissues associated with disease mutations that do not occur at position 715 in the UniprotKB database.
(1) Retrieve the uberon anatomical ID from disease mutation tissue for all diseases with a mutation location that is not equal to amino acid position 715 in the UniProtKB database.
(2) Find the anatomical identifiers for tissues that have mutations associated with a disease, but only for those mutations where the amino acid position in UniprotKB is not equal to 715.
(3) Retrieve the anatomical identifier of the tissues affected by mutations associated with diseases, but only for mutations where the amino acid position in UniprotKB is not 715.
(4) Get the anatomical IDs of tissues associated with disease mutations that have a non-null amino acid position in UniProtKB.
(5) Retrieve the uberon anatomical IDs for tissues associated with disease mutations where the amino acid position in UniprotKB is not equal to 715.
(6) Get the Uberon anatomical ID from the disease_mutation_tissue table where the aa_pos_uniprotkb column in the disease_mutation table is not equal to 715.
(7) Retrieve the uberon anatomical ID from the disease mutation tissue table for all disease mutations that do not have a specific amino acid position of 715 in the UniProtKB database.
