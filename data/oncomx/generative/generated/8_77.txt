Original Query:
SELECT T1.expression_level_anatomical_relative FROM healthy_expression AS T1 WHERE T1.uberon_developmental_id != "MmusDv:0000076"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the expression levels of genes in healthy tissue, excluding developmental tissue, from the database "healthy_expression".
(1) Retrieve the relative expression levels in healthy tissue from all anatomical regions except for the developmental stage "adult" in mice.
(2) Retrieve the relative expression levels in anatomical structures for healthy samples where the developmental stage is not "adult".
(3) Retrieve the expression level of anatomical structures relative to a given developmental stage from the table "healthy_expression" excluding data for Mus musculus embryos.
(4) Retrieve the relative expression levels in anatomical structures for healthy samples, excluding those from Mus musculus developmental stage 22.
(5) Retrieve the expression level in an anatomical context from healthy mice where the developmental stage is not embryonic.
(6) Retrieve the expression level in anatomical context from healthy individuals, excluding the developmental stage corresponding to "mouse embryo".
(7) Get the expression level anatomical relative from the table healthy_expression, but only for rows where the developmental identifier is not "MmusDv:0000076".
