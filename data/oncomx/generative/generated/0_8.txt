Original Query:
SELECT T1.disease_mutation_id FROM disease_mutation_tissue AS T1 WHERE T1.uberon_anatomical_id = "UBERON:0002108"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the disease and mutation IDs associated with a tissue located in the UBeron anatomical region with ID "UBERON:0002108".
(1) Retrieve the disease mutation ID from the table "disease_mutation_tissue" where the Uberon anatomical ID is equal to "UBERON:0002108".
(2) Retrieve the disease mutation ID from the disease_mutation_tissue table where the UBERON anatomical ID is "UBERON:0002108".
(3) "Retrieve the disease-mutation IDs associated with tissue samples from the kidney (UBERON:0002108) in the disease_mutation_tissue table."
(4) Retrieve the disease mutation ID from the disease_mutation_tissue table where the uberon_anatomical_id is "UBERON:0002108".
(5) Find the disease mutation IDs associated with a particular tissue having the UBERON anatomical ID of "UBERON:0002108".
(6) Find the disease mutation IDs for all records in the disease_mutation_tissue table where the uberon_anatomical_id is equal to "UBERON:0002108".
(7) Retrieve the disease mutation ID from the disease_mutation_tissue table where the uberon_anatomical_id is equal to "UBERON:0002108".
