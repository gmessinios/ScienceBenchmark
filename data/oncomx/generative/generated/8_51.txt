###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.call_quality FROM healthy_expression AS T1 WHERE T1.uberon_developmental_id != "MmusDv:0000045"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) What is the call quality for healthy expression when the uberon developmental ID is not equal to "MmusDv:0000045"?
(1) What is the call quality of healthy expression data for developmental stages other than "embryonic or postnatal"?
(2) Find the call quality from healthy expression data, excluding those with a developmental ID of "MmusDv:0000045".
(3) What is the call quality for healthy expression data, excluding any data from Mus musculus developmental stage MmusDv:0000045?
(4) What is the call quality for all healthy expressions except for those associated with Mouse developmental stage MmusDv:0000045?
(5) What is the call quality of healthy expression for all developmental stages except "MmusDv:0000045"?
(6) Get the call quality from healthy expression where the developmental ID is not equal to "MmusDv:0000045".
(7) What is the call quality of healthy expression for developmental stages that are not MmusDv:0000045?
