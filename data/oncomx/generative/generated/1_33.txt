SELECT biomarker_fda.test_submission FROM biomarker_fda AS biomarker_fda JOIN biomarker AS biomarker ON biomarker_fda.id = biomarker.id WHERE biomarker.biomarker_description = "Ubiquitin, one of the most highly conserved proteins, is coded for by a family of genes whose translation products give rise to several different proteins.  There are four genes that code for ubiquitin: UBB, UBC, RPS27A, and UBA52.  Ubiquitin is synthesized as a precursor protein consisting of either polyubiquitin chains or a single ubiquitin moiety fused to an unrelated protein. This gene codes for a polyubiquitin precursor.  Polyubiquitin chains, when attached to a target protein, have different functions depending on the Lys residue of the ubiquitin that is linked: Lys-6-linked may be involved in DNA repair; Lys-11-linked is involved in ERAD (endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation) and in cell-cycle regulation; Lys-29-linked is involved in lysosomal degradation; Lys-33-linked is involved in kinase modification; Lys-48-linked is involved in protein degradation via the proteasome; Lys-63-linked is involved in endocytosis, DNA-damage responses as well as in signaling processes leading to activation of the transcription factor NF-kappa-B. Linear polymer chains formed via attachment by the initiator Met lead to cell signaling. Ubiquitin is usually conjugated to Lys residues of target proteins, however, in rare cases, conjugation to Cys or Ser residues has been observed. When polyubiquitin is free (unanchored-polyubiquitin), it also has distinct roles, such as in activation of protein kinases, and in signaling."
