Original Query:
SELECT T1.ref_aa FROM disease_mutation AS T1    ORDER BY T1.aa_pos_uniprotkb DESC LIMIT 1
GPT-3 choices:
(0) What is the amino acid at the highest position in the UniprotKB database for all disease mutations?
(1) "Get the reference amino acid from the disease mutation table, sorted in descending order by the UniProtKB amino acid position and limited to one result."
(2) Find the amino acid abbreviation for the highest numbered position in the UniProtKB column of the disease_mutation table, and list it in ascending order with only one result.
(3) "Retrieve the reference amino acid from the disease mutation table, ordering by the amino acid position in UniProtKB in descending order and limiting the result to one row."
(4) Find the amino acid reference for a disease mutation by sorting the results in descending order based on its position and selecting only one result.
(5) What is the reference amino acid for the disease mutation in the highest position according to the UniProtKB?
(6) What is the reference amino acid from the "disease_mutation" table, ordered by the uniprotkb position in descending order and limited to 1 result?
(7) What is the amino acid at the position with the highest number in the disease_mutation table, ordered from highest to lowest, limited to only one result?
