Original Query:
SELECT T1.subjects_up FROM differential_expression AS T1 WHERE T1.expression_change_direction = "down" and T1.subjects_total = 36
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the number of subjects that experienced a decrease in expression and have a total of 36 subjects in the table of differential expression data.
(1) Retrieve the subjects that have an expression change direction of "down" and a total subject count of 36 from the table "differential_expression".
(2) Find the number of subjects with up-regulated differential expression where there was a total of 36 subjects and the expression change direction was down.
(3) Retrieve the number of subjects that have a decrease in expression level out of a total of 36 subjects from the differential expression table.
(4) Retrieve the number of subjects with an upregulated gene expression out of a total of 36 subjects from the differential expression data.
(5) Find the number of subjects that have an expression change direction of "down" and a total of 36 in the differential expression table.
(6) Get the number of subjects who have a decrease in expression and a total of 36 subjects from the table "differential_expression."
(7) What are the subjects who had an expression change direction of "down" in differential expression and a total of 36 subjects?
