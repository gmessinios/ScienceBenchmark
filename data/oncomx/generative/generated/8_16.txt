Original Query:
SELECT T1.biomarker_internal_id FROM biomarker_alias AS T1 WHERE T1.alias != "AKR1B11"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the biomarker internal ID for the biomarker aliases that are not equal to "AKR1B11" from the table of biomarker aliases.
(1) Get the biomarker internal ID for all entries in the biomarker alias table where the alias is not "AKR1B11".
(2) Retrieve the biomarker internal ID from the biomarker_alias table for all aliases that are not "AKR1B11".
(3) What is the biomarker internal ID for the alias "AKR1B11" in the table "biomarker_alias"?
(4) Find the biomarker internal ID for any aliases in the biomarker_alias table where the alias is not equal to "AKR1B11".
(5) Find the internal ID for a biomarker in the table "biomarker_alias" where the alias is not equal to "AKR1B11".
(6) Find the internal ID for biomarkers with aliases that are not "AKR1B11".
(7) Find the internal ID of the biomarker that has an alias different from "AKR1B11" in the biomarker_alias table.
