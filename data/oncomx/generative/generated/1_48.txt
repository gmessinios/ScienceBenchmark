Original Query:
SELECT T1.uberon_anatomical_id FROM disease_mutation_tissue AS T1 JOIN disease_mutation AS T2 ON T1.disease_mutation_id = T2.id WHERE T2.ref_aa = "D"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Get the anatomical identifier of tissues from a table that joins two tables, one containing information on disease mutations and the other containing information on tissue locations, where the reference amino acid for each mutation is "D".
(1) Retrieve the uberon anatomical ID from the disease_mutation_tissue table where the reference amino acid in the corresponding disease_mutation record is "D".
(2) What is the uberon anatomical ID for tissues associated with disease mutations that have a reference amino acid of "D"?
(3) Find the Uberon anatomical ID for tissues associated with a disease mutation where the reference amino acid is "D".
(4) Retrieve the Uberon anatomical ID from the disease_mutation_tissue table where the ref_aa column in the disease_mutation table is equal to "D".
(5) Retrieve the unique anatomical identifier for tissues affected by mutations in diseases where the mutated amino acid is "D".
(6) Retrieve the unique anatomical identifier from the disease_mutation_tissue table for all records where the ref_aa column in the disease_mutation table is equal to "D".
(7) Find the uberon anatomical ID for disease mutation tissue where the reference amino acid is "D".
