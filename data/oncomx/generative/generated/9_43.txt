Original Query:
SELECT T1.disease_mutation_id FROM disease_mutation_tissue AS T1 JOIN anatomical_entity AS T2 ON T1.uberon_anatomical_id = T2.id WHERE T2.id != "UBERON:0001165"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the disease mutation IDs from the disease_mutation_tissue table where the associated anatomical entity is not "UBERON:0001165".
(1) Retrieve the disease mutation ID from the disease_mutation_tissue table where the UBERON anatomical ID is not equal to "UBERON:0001165" and is joined with the anatomical_entity table.
(2) Retrieve the disease mutation ID from the disease_mutation_tissue table where the associated anatomical entity is not "UBERON:0001165".
(3) What is the disease mutation ID for all disease-mutation-tissue associations, excluding those where the associated anatomical entity is not "UBERON:0001165"?
(4) Retrieve the disease mutation IDs from the disease_mutation_tissue table where the associated anatomical entity is not "UBERON:0001165" in the anatomical_entity table.
(5) Get the disease mutation IDs from the table disease_mutation_tissue, where the associated uberon_anatomical_id is not equal to "UBERON:0001165" and corresponds to a different anatomical entity in the table anatomical_entity.
(6) Find the disease mutation ids from the table disease_mutation_tissue where the corresponding anatomical entity's uberon_anatomical_id is not equal to "UBERON:0001165".
(7) Find the disease mutation IDs associated with anatomical entities that are not the liver.
