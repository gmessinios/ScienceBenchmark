Original Query:
SELECT T1.chromosome_pos FROM disease_mutation AS T1 JOIN disease_mutation_article AS T2 ON T1.id = T2.disease_mutation_id WHERE T2.disease_mutation_id = 79667
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the chromosome position from the disease mutation and corresponding article where the disease mutation ID is 79667.
(1) Retrieve the chromosome position from the disease_mutation table where the disease_mutation_id is 79667, and this ID also exists in the disease_mutation_article table.
(2) Get the chromosome position from the disease_mutation table where the id in disease_mutation_article is equal to 79667.
(3) Find the chromosome position from the disease mutation table where the disease mutation ID is equal to 79667 and is associated with an article in the disease mutation article table.
(4) Find the chromosome position from the disease mutation table for the disease mutation with an ID of 79667, joined with data from the disease mutation article table.
(5) Retrieve the chromosome position for the disease mutation with an ID of 79667, which is associated with an article in the disease_mutation_article table.
(6) Find the chromosome position of the disease mutation with an ID of 79667, as listed in the disease_mutation_article table.
(7) Retrieve the chromosome position from the disease mutation table for all records in which the disease mutation ID matches 79667, while also joining with the disease mutation article table and matching on IDs.
