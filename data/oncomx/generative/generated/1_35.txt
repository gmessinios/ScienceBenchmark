GPT-3 choices:
(0) Get the id of all disease mutation impact predictions where the alternate amino acid in the corresponding disease mutation is "S".
(1) Retrieve the id from disease_mutation_impact_prediction where the alternative amino acid is "S" in the disease_mutation table.
(2) What is the ID of the disease mutation impact prediction for a disease mutation with an alternative amino acid of "S"?
(3) What is the id of disease mutation impact predictions where the alternate amino acid in the associated disease mutation is "S"?
(4) Find the ID of all disease mutation impact predictions that have a disease mutation with an alternate amino acid "S".
(5) What is the impact prediction ID for all disease mutation records where the alternate amino acid is "S"?
(6) Find the id of disease_mutation_impact_prediction where the alternative amino acid in the corresponding disease_mutation is "S".
(7) Get the ID from the disease_mutation_impact_prediction table where the alternative amino acid in the associated disease_mutation is "S".
