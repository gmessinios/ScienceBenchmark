Original Query:
SELECT T1.id FROM disease_mutation_impact_prediction AS T1    ORDER BY T1.disease_mutation_id DESC LIMIT 1
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the highest ID from the disease_mutation_impact_prediction table, sorted in descending order by the disease_mutation_id column and limited to 1 row.
(1) "Retrieve the highest ID value from the disease_mutation_impact_prediction table, sorted in descending order by the disease_mutation_id column and limiting the result to 1."
(2) "Get the ID from the disease_mutation_impact_prediction table, ordering it by the disease_mutation_id in descending order and limit the result to 1."
(3) Find the ID of the most recent disease-mutation impact prediction from the table "disease_mutation_impact_prediction" and order it in descending order by its associated disease-mutation ID, with a limit of one result.
(4) What is the ID of the latest disease mutation impact prediction in the table "disease_mutation_impact_prediction", sorted in descending order by the column "disease_mutation_id"?
(5) "Retrieve the id from disease_mutation_impact_prediction table, sorting by disease_mutation_id in descending order, and limit the result to 1."
(6) Get the ID from the table "disease_mutation_impact_prediction" sorted by descending order of the column "disease_mutation_id", and limit the result to one row.
(7) "Retrieve the id from the disease_mutation_impact_prediction table, sorted by descending order of disease_mutation_id and only return the last row."
