Original Query:
SELECT T1.pmid FROM biomarker_article AS T1 JOIN biomarker AS T2 ON T1.biomarker_internal_id = T2.id WHERE T2.gene_symbol != "PDLIM4"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the PMID values from the biomarker_article table for articles that are associated with a biomarker where the gene symbol is not equal to "PDLIM4".
(1) Find the PubMed IDs for articles associated with biomarkers, where the gene symbol is not "PDLIM4".
(2) Retrieve the PMID of articles associated with biomarkers that have a gene symbol other than "PDLIM4".
(3) Retrieve the PMID values from the biomarker_article table where the gene symbol in the associated biomarker record is not equal to "PDLIM4".
(4) Retrieve the PubMed IDs of articles that have been linked to biomarkers, excluding any articles related to the biomarker with the gene symbol "PDLIM4".
(5) What are the PubMed IDs of articles that mention a biomarker with a gene symbol different than "PDLIM4"?
(6) "Find the PubMed IDs from articles associated with biomarkers, excluding those where the biomarker's gene symbol is not "PDLIM4".
(7) What is the PubMed ID for articles where the gene symbol associated with a biomarker is not "PDLIM4"?
