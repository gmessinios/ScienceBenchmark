Original Query:
SELECT T1.test_is_a_panel FROM biomarker AS T1 JOIN biomarker_article AS T2 ON T1.id = T2.biomarker_internal_id WHERE T2.pmid != "16424007"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the information on whether a biomarker is considered a panel or not in the biomarker table, specifically looking at data from both the biomarker and biomarker_article tables where the PubMed ID is not equal to 16424007.
(1) Retrieve the information about whether the biomarker is a panel or not for all biomarkers that are mentioned in an article with a PMID that is not equal to "16424007".
(2) Find the value of the "test_is_a_panel" column from the "biomarker" table where the ID in the biomarker table matches the internal ID in the biomarker_article table, and exclude any entries with a PMID of 16424007.
(3) Retrieve the boolean value indicating whether the test corresponding to a biomarker mentioned in an article with PMID "16424007" is a panel.
(4) Get the test_is_a_panel values for biomarkers associated with articles that have a PMID other than "16424007".
(5) What is the boolean value indicating whether or not the biomarker identified by a given PubMed ID is classified as a panel?
(6) Retrieve the test_is_a_panel field from the biomarker table for all records where the PMID in the biomarker_article table is not equal to "16424007".
(7) Retrieve the test_is_a_panel field from the biomarker table where the id in biomarker is equal to the biomarker_internal_id in biomarker_article and the pmid in biomarker_article is not equal to "16424007".
