SELECT disease_mutation_tissue.disease_mutation_id FROM disease_mutation_tissue AS disease_mutation_tissue WHERE disease_mutation_tissue.uberon_anatomical_id != "UBERON:0001043"

###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.disease_mutation_id FROM disease_mutation_tissue AS T1 WHERE T1.uberon_anatomical_id != "UBERON:0001043"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the disease mutation IDs from the table disease_mutation_tissue where the uberon_anatomical_id is not equal to "UBERON:0001043".
(1) Find all disease-mutation IDs from the table "disease_mutation_tissue" where the anatomical location is not "lower urinary tract".
(2) Retrieve the disease mutation IDs from the disease_mutation_tissue table where the uberon_anatomical_id is not equal to "UBERON:0001043".
(3) Find the disease-mutation IDs for all disease-mutation-tissue associations where the tissue is not the tongue.
(4) "Retrieve the disease-mutation IDs from the disease_mutation_tissue table where the uberon_anatomical_id is not equal to 'UBERON:0001043'."
(5) Find the disease mutation IDs for which there is a mismatch between the associated tissue and the UBERON anatomical ID "UBERON:0001043".
(6) Get the IDs of disease-mutation-tissue combinations that are not associated with the anatomical location UBERON:0001043.
(7) Find all disease-mutation pairs in the tissue-disease database that are not associated with the anatomical structure "cervix".
