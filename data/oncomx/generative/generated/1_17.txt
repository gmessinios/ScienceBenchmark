Original Query:
SELECT T1.data_source FROM disease_mutation AS T1 JOIN disease_mutation_site_annotation AS T2 ON T1.id = T2.disease_mutation_id WHERE T2.description = "Aromatic amino acid; via carbonyl oxygen"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the data source of disease mutations where the disease mutation site is annotated as involving an aromatic amino acid through a carbonyl oxygen.
(1) Find the data sources for disease mutations that have a site annotation describing an aromatic amino acid through the carbonyl oxygen.
(2) What is the source of data for disease mutations that have been annotated as involving an aromatic amino acid via a carbonyl oxygen?
(3) Get the data source from the table that shows the disease mutations with annotations for aromatic amino acids via carbonyl oxygen.
(4) Retrieve the data source of disease mutations that have a site annotation describing an aromatic amino acid via a carbonyl oxygen.
(5) Find the data sources for disease mutations that have a site annotation of "Aromatic amino acid; via carbonyl oxygen".
(6) Retrieve the data source from disease_mutation where the disease_mutation_site_annotation's description is "Aromatic amino acid; via carbonyl oxygen".
(7) Retrieve the data source of disease mutations from the database, where the description in the site annotation is "Aromatic amino acid; via carbonyl oxygen".
