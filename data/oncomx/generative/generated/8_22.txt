SELECT biomarker_fda_test_use.approved_indication FROM biomarker_fda_test_use AS biomarker_fda_test_use WHERE biomarker_fda_test_use.test_submission != "P100033"

###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.approved_indication FROM biomarker_fda_test_use AS T1 WHERE T1.test_submission != "P100033"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the approved indication for biomarkers from submissions other than "P100033" in the FDA test use database.
(1) What are the approved indications for all biomarker tests submitted to the FDA except for test submission P100033?
(2) What is the approved indication for biomarker_fda_test_use when the test submission is not equal to "P100033"?
(3) What is the approved indication for biomarkers that have a test submission other than "P100033" in the biomarker_fda_test_use table?
(4) Retrieve the approved indication from the biomarker_fda_test_use table for all tests except those with a test_submission of "P100033".
(5) What are the approved indications for biomarker FDA test use submissions that are not equal to "P100033"?
(6) Which approved indications are associated with the biomarker-fda test use entries where the test submission is not equal to "P100033"?
(7) Retrieve the approved indication for all biomarker FDA tests, excluding the test with a test submission of "P100033".
