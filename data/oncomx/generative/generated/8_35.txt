###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.expression_level_gene_relative FROM healthy_expression AS T1 WHERE T1.expression_level_anatomical_relative != "LOW"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the expression levels for all genes in healthy individuals where the anatomical expression level is not "LOW".
(1) Retrieve the expression level of genes from healthy individuals where the anatomical expression level is not low.
(2) Retrieve the relative expression level of healthy genes where the anatomical relative expression level is not "LOW".
(3) Find the relative expression levels for genes in healthy tissue where the anatomical expression level is not considered "LOW".
(4) Get the relative gene expression levels from healthy individuals where the anatomical relative expression level is not "LOW".
(5) "Retrieve the expression level gene relative from healthy_expression where the anatomical relative expression level is not low."
(6) What is the expression level of genes from healthy tissue that is not considered "LOW" in terms of anatomical relative expression level?
(7) Retrieve the relative gene expression levels from the healthy_expression table where the anatomical relative expression level is not "LOW".
