Original Query:
SELECT T1.uberon_anatomical_id FROM disease_mutation_tissue AS T1 WHERE T1.disease_mutation_id = 3878
GPT-3 choices:
(0) What is the uberon anatomical ID of the disease mutation tissue associated with the disease mutation with an ID of 3878?
(1) What is the unique anatomical ID of the tissue associated with the mutation that has an ID of 3878 in the disease_mutation_tissue table?
(2) Retrieve the UBERON anatomical ID from the disease_mutation_tissue table for the disease mutation with an ID of 3878.
(3) What is the uberon anatomical ID associated with the disease mutation with an ID of 3878 in the table "disease_mutation_tissue"?
(4) Get the Uberon anatomical ID from the disease_mutation_tissue table where the disease_mutation_id is equal to 3878.
(5) What is the anatomical ID in the disease mutation tissue table for the disease mutation with an ID of 3878?
(6) Get the uberon anatomical ID from the disease mutation tissue table for the disease mutation with an ID of 3878.
(7) Find the unique identifier for the anatomical location in which a mutation is associated with a specific disease, given that the mutation has an ID of 3878.
