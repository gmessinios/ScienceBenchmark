Original Query:

GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the data source for all disease mutations that have been linked to a tissue other than the lymph node.
(1) Retrieve the data source from the disease_mutation table where the associated disease_mutation_tissue record has an uberon_anatomical_id that is not "UBERON:0016435".
(2) Retrieve the data source from disease_mutation for entries where the associated tissue is not "male reproductive system".
(3) Retrieve the data source from the disease_mutation table where the corresponding disease_mutation_tissue entry has an uberon_anatomical_id that is not equal to "UBERON:0016435".
(4) Retrieve the data source from the table "disease_mutation" for all entries that have a corresponding entry in the table "disease_mutation_tissue" where the uberon_anatomical_id is not equal to "UBERON:0016435".
(5) Get the data source for disease mutations that have a tissue specified by a UBERON anatomical ID other than "UBERON:0016435".
(6) Retrieve the data source of disease mutations from the database where the associated tissue is not "nerve".
(7) Retrieve the data source of disease mutations where the corresponding tissue is not "smooth muscle".
