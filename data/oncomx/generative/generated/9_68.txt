Original Query:
SELECT T1.biomarker_description FROM biomarker AS T1 JOIN biomarker_alias AS T2 ON T1.id = T2.biomarker_internal_id WHERE T2.alias != "acylcholine acylhydrolase"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the description of biomarkers that have aliases other than "acylcholine acylhydrolase".
(1) What is the description of the biomarker that is associated with an alias other than "acylcholine acylhydrolase"?
(2) What is the description of the biomarker that has an alias other than "acylcholine acylhydrolase"?
(3) "Retrieve the biomarker description from the biomarker table where the alias is not equal to "acylcholine acylhydrolase" in the biomarker_alias table."
(4) Get the biomarker description from the table biomarker where the alias is not "acylcholine acylhydrolase" and join it with the table biomarker_alias using their respective IDs.
(5) What is the biomarker description for all biomarkers where the alias is not "acylcholine acylhydrolase"?
(6) Retrieve the description of all biomarkers, excluding those with the alias "acylcholine acylhydrolase".
(7) Retrieve the description of all biomarkers that have an alias other than "acylcholine acylhydrolase".
