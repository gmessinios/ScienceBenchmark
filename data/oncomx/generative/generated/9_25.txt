Original Query:
SELECT T1.biomarker_drug FROM biomarker_fda_drug AS T1 JOIN biomarker_fda AS T2 ON T1.biomarker_fda_id = T2.id WHERE T2.test_trade_name != "Oncomine Dx Target Test"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) What is the biomarker drug for all biomarkers in the FDA database except those with a test trade name of "Oncomine Dx Target Test"?
(1) Get the drug names for biomarkers associated with FDA-approved tests that are not named "Oncomine Dx Target Test".
(2) Find all biomarker drugs that have been approved by the FDA for use as a test, but do not include any with the trade name "Oncomine Dx Target Test".
(3) Retrieve the biomarker drugs from the FDA for biomarkers that are not associated with the "Oncomine Dx Target Test" in the list of approved tests.
(4) Retrieve the name of all biomarker drugs from the FDA biomarker list where the corresponding test trade name is not "Oncomine Dx Target Test".
(5) Get the names of all drugs associated with biomarkers in FDA-approved biomarker tests, excluding the drug associated with the Oncomine Dx Target Test.
(6) Retrieve the biomarker drugs from the FDA database where the test trade name is not "Oncomine Dx Target Test".
(7) "Retrieve the biomarker and corresponding FDA-approved drug from the database where the FDA test trade name is not 'Oncomine Dx Target Test'."
