Original Query:

GPT-3 choices:
(0) What are the species that have a matching record in the xref_gene_ensembl table, excluding those with an ensembl_gene_id of "ENSG00000054598"?
(1) What is the name of the species in which a gene with the ensembl ID "ENSG00000054598" is not found?
(2) Retrieve the names of all species from the "species" table that are associated with any Ensembl gene ID other than "ENSG00000054598" in the "xref_gene_ensembl" table.
(3) What is the species associated with the Ensembl gene ID "ENSG00000054598" in the xref_gene_ensembl table, excluding "ENSG00000054598"?
(4) What are the species that have a matching species id in the species table and an Ensembl gene ID in the xref_gene_ensembl table, excluding "ENSG00000054598"?
(5) Retrieve the names of species from the database, along with their associated Ensembl gene IDs, as long as the Ensembl gene ID is not "ENSG00000054598".
(6) What is the species of genes that have an Ensembl gene ID other than "ENSG00000054598"?
(7) Return the species names for all species that have an Ensembl gene ID other than "ENSG00000054598" in the xref_gene_ensembl table, by joining the species table and xref_gene_ensembl table on their shared species ID.
