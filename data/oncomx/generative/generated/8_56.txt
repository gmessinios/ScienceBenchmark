Original Query:
SELECT T1.test_manufacturer FROM biomarker_fda_test AS T1 WHERE T1.clinical_significance != "The therascreen KRAS RGQ PCR Kit is a real-time qualitative PCR assay used on the Rotor-Gene Q MDx instrument for the detection of seven somatic mutations in the human KRAS oncogene, using DNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE), colorectal cancer (CRC) tissue."
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the test manufacturer from the FDA biomarker test where the clinical significance is not "The therascreen KRAS RGQ PCR Kit is a real-time qualitative PCR assay used on the Rotor-Gene Q MDx instrument for the detection of seven somatic mutations in the human KRAS oncogene, using DNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE), colorectal cancer (CRC) tissue.".
(1) Retrieve the test manufacturer from the FDA approved biomarker tests for which the clinical significance is not "The therascreen KRAS RGQ PCR Kit is a real-time qualitative PCR assay used on the Rotor-Gene Q MDx instrument for the detection of seven somatic mutations in the human KRAS oncogene, using DNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE), colorectal cancer (CRC) tissue."
(2) What are the manufacturers of biomarker FDA tests that have a clinical significance other than "The therascreen KRAS RGQ PCR Kit is a real-time qualitative PCR assay used on the Rotor-Gene Q MDx instrument for the detection of seven somatic mutations in the human KRAS oncogene, using DNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE), colorectal cancer (CRC) tissue"?
(3) Retrieve the name of the test manufacturer for all biomarker FDA tests where the clinical significance is not "The therascreen KRAS RGQ PCR Kit is a real-time qualitative PCR assay used on the Rotor-Gene Q MDx instrument for the detection of seven somatic mutations in the human KRAS oncogene, using DNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE), colorectal cancer (CRC) tissue."
(4) Retrieve the name of the test manufacturer for biomarker FDA tests where the clinical significance is not equal to "The therascreen KRAS RGQ PCR Kit is a real-time qualitative PCR assay used on the Rotor-Gene Q MDx instrument for the detection of seven somatic mutations in the human KRAS oncogene, using DNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE), colorectal cancer (CRC) tissue."
(5) What is the manufacturer of biomarker tests that have a clinical significance other than detecting seven somatic mutations in the human KRAS oncogene from FFPE CRC tissue using the therascreen KRAS RGQ PCR Kit on the Rotor-Gene Q MDx instrument?
(6) Retrieve the test manufacturer from the biomarker_fda_test table where the clinical significance is not equal to "The therascreen KRAS RGQ PCR Kit is a real-time qualitative PCR assay used on the Rotor-Gene Q MDx instrument for the detection of seven somatic mutations in the human KRAS oncogene, using DNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE), colorectal cancer (CRC) tissue."
(7) Find the manufacturer of biomarker tests that have a clinical significance different from "The therascreen KRAS RGQ PCR Kit is a real-time qualitative PCR assay used on the Rotor-Gene Q MDx instrument for the detection of seven somatic mutations in the human KRAS oncogene, using DNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE), colorectal cancer (CRC) tissue".
