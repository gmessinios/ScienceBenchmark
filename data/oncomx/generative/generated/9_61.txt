Original Query:
SELECT T1.speciesid FROM xref_gene_ensembl AS T1 JOIN healthy_expression AS T2 ON T1.ensembl_gene_id = T2.ensembl_gene_id WHERE T2.expression_score != 11.70000
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the species ID from the XREF_GENE_ENSEMBL table where the ensembl gene ID matches and join it with the healthy_expression table, returning only those records where the expression score is not equal to 11.7.
(1) Find the species ID from the xref_gene_ensembl table where the ensembl_gene_id matches with the ensembl_gene_id in the healthy_expression table, but only for rows where the expression_score is not equal to 11.70000.
(2) Get the species ID from the table "xref_gene_ensembl" where the Ensembl gene ID matches between that table and the "healthy_expression" table, and exclude any entries where the expression score in "healthy_expression" is equal to 11.70000.
(3) Find the species IDs of all genes in the healthy_expression table that have an expression score that is not equal to 11.7 and are also present in the xref_gene_ensembl table.
(4) Find the species IDs from the xref_gene_ensembl table for genes that have an expression score not equal to 11.70000 in the healthy_expression table.
(5) Get the species ID from the xref_gene_ensembl table for genes in healthy_expression that have an expression score not equal to 11.70000 and join them with the ensembl_gene_id column in xref_gene_ensembl to get their corresponding species IDs.
(6) Retrieve the species ID from the xref_gene_ensembl table where the ensembl_gene_id matches with that in the healthy_expression table and the expression_score is not equal to 11.70000.
(7) Retrieve the species ID from the xref_gene_ensembl table for genes that have a non-constant expression score in the healthy_expression table.
