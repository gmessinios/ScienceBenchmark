Original Query:

GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the PMIDs of articles related to disease-mutation associations where the associated transcript ID is not "ENST00000218068".
(1) Find the PMID for articles associated with disease-mutation pairs where the ensembl transcript ID is not "ENST00000218068".
(2) Retrieve the PubMed IDs of articles that are associated with disease mutations, excluding those that are associated with the Ensembl transcript ID "ENST00000218068".
(3) Retrieve the PMID numbers of articles associated with disease mutations, excluding those that have an Ensembl transcript ID of "ENST00000218068".
(4) Find the PubMed IDs of articles that are associated with a disease mutation, but only if the corresponding ensembl transcript ID is not "ENST00000218068".
(5) Find the PMID numbers of articles in which a disease mutation is mentioned, excluding those where the ensembl transcript ID is "ENST00000218068".
(6) Retrieve the PubMed IDs for articles associated with disease-mutation pairs where the Ensembl transcript ID of the disease mutation is not "ENST00000218068".
(7) Find all PMIDs from articles related to disease mutations that are not associated with the ENST00000218068 transcript ID.
