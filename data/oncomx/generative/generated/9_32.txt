Original Query:
SELECT T1.gene_symbol FROM xref_gene_ensembl AS T1 JOIN healthy_expression AS T2 ON T1.ensembl_gene_id = T2.ensembl_gene_id WHERE T2.ensembl_gene_id != "ENSG00000005513"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Get the gene symbols from the xref_gene_ensembl table for all genes that are present in both the xref_gene_ensembl and healthy_expression tables, excluding those with an ensembl_gene_id equal to "ENSG00000005513".
(1) Retrieve the gene symbol from xref_gene_ensembl for all entries where the ensembl_gene_id does not match "ENSG00000005513" in healthy_expression.
(2) What are the gene symbols from the xref_gene_ensembl table for genes in healthy_expression that are not equal to "ENSG00000005513"?
(3) What are the gene symbols for all genes in the healthy expression table that do not have an ensembl gene ID of "ENSG00000005513"?
(4) Retrieve the gene symbol from the xref_gene_ensembl table for all genes in healthy_expression that have an Ensembl gene ID different than "ENSG00000005513".
(5) Find the gene symbol for all genes in the xref_gene_ensembl table that have an ensembl_gene_id that does not equal "ENSG00000005513" and are also present in the healthy_expression table.
(6) Retrieve the gene symbol from the xref_gene_ensembl table where the ensembl_gene_id matches with the ensembl_gene_id in the healthy_expression table, excluding rows with an ensembl_gene_id of "ENSG00000005513".
(7) Find the gene symbol for all genes in xref_gene_ensembl that have an ensembl_gene_id that is not equal to "ENSG00000005513" in healthy_expression.
