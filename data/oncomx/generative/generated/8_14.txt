###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.uberon_anatomical_id FROM disease_mutation_tissue AS T1 WHERE T1.disease_mutation_id != 17312
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the unique anatomical ID for all disease-mutation-tissue combinations except those with an ID of 17312.
(1) What is the uberon anatomical ID for the disease mutation tissue, excluding the one with a disease mutation ID of 17312?
(2) What is the uberon anatomical id for disease-mutation-tissue data where the disease mutation id is not equal to 17312?
(3) Find the uberon anatomical ID for all disease mutation tissues, except those with a disease mutation ID of 17312.
(4) Get the uberon anatomical ID from the disease_mutation_tissue table where the disease mutation ID is not equal to 17312.
(5) Find the anatomical identifier from the disease mutation tissue table for all records except those with a specific disease mutation id.
(6) Retrieve the anatomical identifier for tissues affected by mutations in diseases, excluding those with a specific disease mutation ID.
(7) What are the uberon anatomical IDs of tissues associated with disease mutation entries that do not have an ID of 17312?
