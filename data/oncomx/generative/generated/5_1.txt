Original Query:
SELECT T1.biomarker_origin FROM biomarker_fda_test AS T1    ORDER BY T1.doid DESC LIMIT 1
GPT-3 choices:
(0) What is the origin of the biomarker listed in the last row of the table "biomarker_fda_test", ordered by descending disease ID, with a limit of 1?
(1) What is the biomarker origin of the most recently added entry in the biomarker_fda_test table, according to its associated disease ID in descending order?
(2) Retrieve the origin of the biomarker from the FDA test table, sorted by descending DOID and limited to 1 result.
(3) What is the biomarker origin for the last entry in the biomarker_fda_test table, ordered by doid in descending order?
(4) Get the origin of biomarkers from the most recent entry in the biomarker_fda_test table, sorted by doid in descending order and limited to 1 result.
(5) "Retrieve the origin of biomarkers from the most recently updated entry in the FDA test database, ordered by descending disease ontology identifier, with a limit of one result."
(6) Retrieve the origin of the biomarker from the latest entry in the FDA test records sorted by disease ID in descending order.
(7) "Retrieve the origin of biomarkers from the FDA testing data, sorted in descending order by disease ID and limited to 1 result."
