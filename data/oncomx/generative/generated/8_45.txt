SELECT biomarker_fda_test_use.id FROM biomarker_fda_test_use AS biomarker_fda_test_use WHERE biomarker_fda_test_use.test_trade_name != "INSITE HER-2/NEU KIT"

###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.id FROM biomarker_fda_test_use AS T1 WHERE T1.test_trade_name != "INSITE HER-2/NEU KIT"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the IDs of all biomarkers in use by the FDA, excluding those with a test trade name of "INSITE HER-2/NEU KIT".
(1) What are the IDs of all biomarker FDA test uses that have a test trade name different from "INSITE HER-2/NEU KIT"?
(2) Find the ID of all FDA approved biomarker tests where the test trade name is not "INSITE HER-2/NEU KIT".
(3) Find the IDs of all biomarkers from FDA-approved tests that have a test trade name other than "INSITE HER-2/NEU KIT".
(4) Find the id from biomarker_fda_test_use where the test trade name is not "INSITE HER-2/NEU KIT".
(5) What is the ID of all the entries in biomarker_fda_test_use where test_trade_name is not equal to "INSITE HER-2/NEU KIT"?
(6) What are the IDs of all biomarkers that do not have a test trade name of "INSITE HER-2/NEU KIT"?
(7) What is the ID of the biomarker_fda_test_use record where the test_trade_name is not "INSITE HER-2/NEU KIT"?
