GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the ID of biomarkers that are associated with drugs in the FDA database, where the trade name of the test is "Oncomine Dx Target Test".
(1) Retrieve the biomarker FDA IDs from the table "biomarker_fda_drug" where the associated test trade name in the table "biomarker_fda" is "Oncomine Dx Target Test".
(2) Find the ID of biomarkers associated with drugs in the FDA database where the corresponding FDA biomarker is for a test with trade name "Oncomine Dx Target Test".
(3) Find the FDA biomarker ID for the biomarker associated with the test trade name "Oncomine Dx Target Test".
(4) Retrieve the ID of all biomarker-FDA combinations where the FDA-approved biomarker test has a trade name of "Oncomine Dx Target Test".
(5) Find the FDA ID of biomarkers that are associated with drugs in the Oncomine Dx Target Test.
(6) Retrieve the FDA biomarker ID for the biomarker drug associated with the Oncomine Dx Target Test from the biomarker_fda_drug and biomarker_fda tables.
(7) Find the biomarker FDA ID for the drug associated with the biomarker FDA test "Oncomine Dx Target Test".
