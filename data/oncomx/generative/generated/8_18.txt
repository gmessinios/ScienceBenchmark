SELECT biomarker_fda_ncit_term.biomarker_fda_id FROM biomarker_fda_ncit_term AS biomarker_fda_ncit_term WHERE biomarker_fda_ncit_term.ncit_biomarker != "DIAPH3"

###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.biomarker_fda_id FROM biomarker_fda_ncit_term AS T1 WHERE T1.ncit_biomarker != "DIAPH3"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the FDA biomarker ID from the NCIt terms for all entries where the NCIt biomarker is not "DIAPH3".
(1) What is the biomarker_fda_id for the entry in the biomarker_fda_ncit_term table where the ncit_biomarker is not equal to "DIAPH3"?
(2) Retrieve the biomarker FDA ID from the table of biomarker FDA and NCIT terms where the NCIT biomarker is not equal to "DIAPH3".
(3) Retrieve the FDA biomarker ID from the table of biomarker FDA and NCIt terms where the NCIt biomarker is not equal to "DIAPH3".
(4) What is the FDA biomarker ID for any biomarkers with an NCIt term that is not equal to "DIAPH3"?
(5) What is the FDA biomarker ID for biomarkers that do not have an NCIT term matching "DIAPH3"?
(6) Retrieve the ID of the biomarker from the FDA database where the NCIt biomarker is not "DIAPH3".
(7) What is the biomarker FDA ID for all entries in the biomarker FDA NCIT term table where the NCIT biomarker is not equal to "DIAPH3"?
