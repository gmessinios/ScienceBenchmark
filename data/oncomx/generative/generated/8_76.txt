Original Query:
SELECT T1.ensembl_transcript_id FROM map_protein_disease_mutation AS T1 WHERE T1.peptide_id != "ENSP00000216733"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the Ensembl transcript ID from the map_protein_disease_mutation table where the peptide_id is not equal to "ENSP00000216733".
(1) Return the Ensembl transcript ID from the map_protein_disease_mutation table where the peptide ID is not "ENSP00000216733".
(2) Find the Ensembl transcript ID from map_protein_disease_mutation where the peptide ID is not "ENSP00000216733".
(3) Find the Ensembl transcript IDs from the map of protein-disease mutations where the peptide ID is not "ENSP00000216733".
(4) Retrieve the ensembl transcript ID from the map_protein_disease_mutation table where the peptide_id is not equal to "ENSP00000216733".
(5) Retrieve the Ensembl transcript ID from the protein-disease-mutation mapping table, excluding those with a peptide ID of "ENSP00000216733".
(6) Retrieve the ensembl transcript id from the map_protein_disease_mutation table where the peptide_id is not equal to "ENSP00000216733".
(7) Get the Ensembl transcript ID from the map of protein, disease, and mutation where the peptide ID is not "ENSP00000216733".
