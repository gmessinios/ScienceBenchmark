GPT-3 choices:
(0) How many occurrences of each protein's uniprotkb accession code are there in the map_protein_disease_mutation table?
(1) "Count the number of occurrences for each unique UniprotKB accession code in the map_protein_disease_mutation table."
(2) How many occurrences are there for each unique uniprotkb_ac in the map_protein_disease_mutation table?
(3) How many mutations are associated with each protein's UniProtKB accession number in the map_protein_disease_mutation table?
(4) Count the number of occurrences for each unique protein ID in the map_protein_disease_mutation table and group them together by their corresponding uniprotkb_ac.
(5) How many records are there in the map_protein_disease_mutation table, grouped by the uniprotkb_ac column?
(6) Count the number of mutations associated with each UniProtKB accession in the map_protein_disease_mutation table.
(7) How many mutations are associated with each unique protein in the map_protein_disease_mutation table?
