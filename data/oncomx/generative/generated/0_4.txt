###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.test_is_a_panel FROM biomarker AS T1 WHERE T1.gene_symbol = "EGLN1"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) What is the value of the test_is_a_panel column for the biomarker with a gene symbol of "EGLN1" in the biomarker table?
(1) What is the test_is_a_panel value for the biomarker with a gene symbol of EGLN1 in the biomarker table?
(2) Retrieve the test_is_a_panel value for biomarkers where the gene_symbol is "EGLN1".
(3) "Retrieve the value of the 'test_is_a_panel' column from the 'biomarker' table where the gene symbol is 'EGLN1'."
(4) What is the test_is_a_panel for the biomarker EGLN1 in the biomarker table?
(5) "Retrieve the test_is_a_panel value from biomarker where gene_symbol is equal to EGLN1."
(6) Retrieve whether or not the test associated with the biomarker "EGLN1" is a panel from the biomarker table.
(7) What is the value of "test_is_a_panel" for the biomarker with a gene symbol of "EGLN1"?
