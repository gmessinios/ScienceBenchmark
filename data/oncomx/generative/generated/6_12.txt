GPT-3 choices:
(0) What is the peptide ID from the map of protein-disease mutations where the uniprotkb accession number is A6NMZ2 and ensembl transcript ID is ENST00000225719?
(1) Retrieve the peptide IDs from the protein-disease-mutation mapping where the UniprotKB accession is "A6NMZ2" and the Ensembl transcript ID is "ENST00000225719".
(2) Get the peptide ID for a mutation in the gene A6NMZ2 from the protein-disease-mutation map, where the UniProtKB accession number is "A6NMZ2" and the Ensembl transcript ID is "ENST00000225719".
(3) Find the peptide ID from the table "map_protein_disease_mutation" where the UniProtKB accession number is "A6NMZ2" and the Ensembl transcript ID is "ENST00000225719".
(4) What is the peptide ID for the mutation associated with uniprotkb AC A6NMZ2 and ensembl transcript ID ENST00000225719 in the map protein disease mutation database?
(5) Find the peptide ID for protein A6NMZ2 and ENST00000225719 transcript in the map_protein_disease_mutation table.
(6) Retrieve the peptide ID from the map_protein_disease_mutation table for a protein with UniprotKB accession number A6NMZ2 and Ensembl transcript ID ENST00000225719.
(7) Retrieve the peptide ID from the map_protein_disease_mutation table where the uniprotkb_ac column is equal to "A6NMZ2" and the ensembl_transcript_id column is equal to "ENST00000225719".
