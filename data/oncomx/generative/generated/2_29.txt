GPT-3 choices:
(0) What is the number of biomarker tests for each disease in the biomarker_fda_test table?
(1) How many entries are there for each disease in the biomarker_fda_test table?
(2) What is the number of occurrences for each disease identifier in the biomarker_fda_test table?
(3) How many times does each unique disease ID appear in the biomarker_fda_test table?
(4) Find the count of instances for each disease ID in the FDA's biomarker testing database.
(5) Count the number of occurrences for each disease ID in the biomarker_fda_test table.
(6) "Count the number of entries in the 'biomarker_fda_test' table for each distinct disease (represented by doid) and group the results accordingly."
(7) What is the count of records for each disease (identified by their DOID) in the biomarker_fda_test table?
