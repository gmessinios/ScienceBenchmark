GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the approved indications for all biomarker tests that have been adopted for clinical use, joining data from the "biomarker_fda_test_use" and "biomarker_fda_test" tables where the test trade names match.
(1) Find the approved indication for biomarkers that are currently in clinical use, by joining the biomarker_fda_test_use and biomarker_fda_test tables and selecting the approved indication from the biomarker_fda_test_use table.
(2) Get the approved indication from the biomarker_fda_test_use table where the test trade name matches between biomarker_fda_test_use and biomarker_fda_test, and where the test adoption evidence in biomarker_fda_test is "clinical use".
(3) Retrieve the approved indications for clinical use of biomarker tests from both the biomarker_fda_test and biomarker_fda_test_use tables, based on their matching test trade names.
(4) What are the approved indications for biomarker tests with evidence of clinical use according to the FDA and trade name?
(5) Get the approved indications from biomarker_fda_test_use for all tests that have a test adoption evidence of "clinical use" in biomarker_fda_test.
(6) What are the approved indications for biomarker tests that have been adopted for clinical use by the FDA?
(7) What are the approved indications for biomarker tests that have been adopted for clinical use, based on data from both the biomarker_fda_test_use and biomarker_fda_test tables?
