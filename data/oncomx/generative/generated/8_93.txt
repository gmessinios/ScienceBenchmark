SELECT biomarker_fda_drug.biomarker_fda_id FROM biomarker_fda_drug AS biomarker_fda_drug WHERE biomarker_fda_drug.biomarker_drug != "31703"

###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.biomarker_fda_id FROM biomarker_fda_drug AS T1 WHERE T1.biomarker_drug != "31703"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the biomarker FDA ID from the biomarker FDA drug table where the biomarker drug is not equal to "31703".
(1) Retrieve the FDA ID of biomarkers for drugs that are not "31703".
(2) Show me the biomarker FDA IDs for all drugs in which the biomarker is not "31703".
(3) Find the biomarker FDA IDs from the biomarker FDA drug table where the biomarker drug is not equal to "31703".
(4) Get the FDA IDs for biomarkers that are not associated with drug ID 31703 in the table biomarker_fda_drug.
(5) Retrieve the biomarker FDA ID from the biomarker_fda_drug table where the biomarker_drug is not equal to "31703".
(6) Retrieve the biomarker FDA ID from the biomarker FDA drug table where the biomarker drug is not equal to "31703".
(7) Retrieve the FDA biomarker IDs from the table "biomarker_fda_drug" where the biomarker drug is not equal to "31703".
