Original Query:
SELECT T1.uberon_anatomical_id FROM disease_mutation_tissue AS T1 WHERE T1.disease_mutation_id = 14859
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the UBeron anatomical IDs for tissues associated with the disease mutation ID 14859 from the table disease_mutation_tissue.
(1) Retrieve the Uberon anatomical ID from the disease_mutation_tissue table for a given disease mutation ID of 14859.
(2) Get the anatomical ID from the "uberon_anatomical_id" column of the "disease_mutation_tissue" table where the disease mutation ID is equal to 14859.
(3) What is the anatomical identifier for the tissues associated with disease mutation ID 14859 in the disease_mutation_tissue table?
(4) Retrieve the uberon anatomical id for all entries in the disease_mutation_tissue table where the disease_mutation_id is 14859.
(5) Get the Uberon anatomical ID from the disease mutation tissue table where the disease mutation ID is equal to 14859.
(6) What is the uberon anatomical id for the disease-mutation association with an ID of 14859 in the table disease_mutation_tissue?
(7) Retrieve the uberon anatomical ID from the disease_mutation_tissue table for the record with a disease_mutation_id of 14859.
