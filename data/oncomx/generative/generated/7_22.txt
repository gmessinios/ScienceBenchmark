Original Query:
SELECT T1.alt_nt FROM disease_mutation AS T1 WHERE T1.chromosome_id = "9" or T1.data_source = "cosmic"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve all alternate nucleotides for disease mutations on chromosome 9 or from the data source COSMIC.
(1) "Retrieve the alternate nucleotide for all disease mutations located on chromosome 9 or from the data source COSMIC."
(2) Retrieve the alternate nucleotide from the disease mutation data set where the chromosome is equal to 9 or the data source is "cosmic".
(3) Retrieve the alternative nucleotide from disease mutations where the chromosome ID is 9 or the data source is "cosmic".
(4) Retrieve the alternative nucleotide from the disease_mutation table for any records where the chromosome_id is equal to 9 or the data_source is equal to "cosmic".
(5) What are the alternate nucleotides for disease mutations on chromosome 9 or from the data source COSMIC?
(6) Retrieve all alternate nucleotides from the disease_mutation table where the chromosome_id is 9 or the data_source is "cosmic".
(7) Retrieve the alternate nucleotide information from disease mutations where the chromosome ID is 9 or the data source is "cosmic".
