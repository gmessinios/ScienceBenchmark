###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.doid FROM differential_expression AS T1 WHERE T1.subjects_down != 43
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the DOIDs of differential expression studies where the number of subjects with decreased expression is not equal to 43.
(1) Find the disease ontology IDs for differential expression data where the number of subjects with downregulation is not equal to 43.
(2) Retrieve the Disease Ontology IDs from the table "differential_expression" where the number of subjects with decreased expression is not equal to 43.
(3) Find the disease identifiers for differential expression data where the number of subjects downregulated is not equal to 43.
(4) Retrieve the DOID of differentially expressed genes from a database, where the number of subjects with downregulated expression is not equal to 43.
(5) Retrieve the DOIDs from the table "differential_expression" where the number of subjects with downregulation is not equal to 43.
(6) Retrieve the disease ontology ID from the differential expression table where the number of subjects down is not equal to 43.
(7) Retrieve the Disease Ontology IDs from the Differential Expression table for which the number of subjects who show a decrease in expression is not equal to 43.
