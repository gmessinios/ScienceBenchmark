###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.description FROM disease_mutation_site_annotation AS T1 WHERE T1.feature_key != "modified residue"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) What is the description of the disease mutation site annotation where the feature key is not "modified residue"?
(1) What is the description of all disease mutation sites that are not modified residues?
(2) What are the descriptions of all disease mutation sites that are not modified residues?
(3) Retrieve the descriptions of all disease mutation site annotations where the feature key is not "modified residue".
(4) What is the description of all disease mutation site annotations where the feature key is not "modified residue"?
(5) Retrieve the descriptions of all disease mutations that are not "modified residue" from the database of disease mutation site annotations.
(6) Retrieve the description of all disease mutation site annotations except those with a feature key of "modified residue".
(7) Retrieve the description of all mutation sites that are not modified residues from the disease_mutation_site_annotation table.
