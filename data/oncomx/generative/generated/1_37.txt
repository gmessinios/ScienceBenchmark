Original Query:
SELECT T1.disease_mutation_id FROM disease_mutation_impact_prediction AS T1 JOIN disease_mutation AS T2 ON T1.disease_mutation_id = T2.id WHERE T2.ref_aa = "L"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the disease mutation impact prediction where the reference amino acid is "L" and retrieve the corresponding disease mutation ID from the database.
(1) Retrieve the disease mutation ID from the disease_mutation_impact_prediction table where the reference amino acid in the corresponding entry in the disease_mutation table is "L".
(2) Find the disease mutation ID from the disease_mutation_impact_prediction table that corresponds to a disease_mutation with the reference amino acid "L".
(3) Get the disease mutation IDs from the disease mutation impact prediction table where the reference amino acid is "L" and join it with the disease mutation table.
(4) Retrieve the ID of all disease mutations with a reference amino acid of "L" from the table "disease_mutation_impact_prediction" by joining it with the "disease_mutation" table and selecting the corresponding ID.
(5) Retrieve the disease mutation ID from the table disease_mutation_impact_prediction where the reference amino acid is "L" in the corresponding row of the table disease_mutation.
(6) Retrieve the disease mutation impact predictions for all mutations where the reference amino acid is "L".
(7) Retrieve the disease mutation impact predictions for all disease mutations that have a reference amino acid of "L".
