Original Query:
SELECT T1.expression_level_gene_relative, count(*) FROM healthy_expression AS T1  GROUP BY T1.expression_level_gene_relative
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Count the number of genes and their corresponding relative expression levels in the healthy expression table.
(1) Count the number of instances in the healthy_expression table for each unique value in the expression_level_gene_relative column, and group the results by the values in that column.
(2) Count the number of times a gene's relative expression level appears in the table for healthy expression and group the results by the gene's relative expression level.
(3) Find the number of instances of relative gene expression levels in healthy individuals and group them by their corresponding expression levels.
(4) What is the number of counts for each expression level of genes in the healthy expression table, grouped by relative gene expression levels?
(5) How many times does each relative gene expression level appear in the healthy_expression table?
(6) What is the number of genes and their corresponding expression levels relative to each other in the healthy_expression table?
(7) How many times does each relative expression level of a gene occur in the healthy_expression table?
