Original Query:
SELECT T1.test_trade_name FROM biomarker_fda_test AS T1 JOIN biomarker_fda AS T2 ON T1.test_trade_name = T2.test_trade_name WHERE T2.id != "FDA000303"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find all test trade names from the biomarker_fda_test table that are not equal to "FDA000303" and join them with the biomarker_fda table on the test_trade_name column, then select only the test_trade_name column from the resulting table.
(1) Find the test trade names from the biomarker FDA test table where the corresponding ID is not "FDA000303" in the biomarker FDA table.
(2) Retrieve the test trade name from the biomarker_fda_test table, excluding those that have an id of "FDA000303", and join it with the biomarker_fda table.
(3) Find the test trade name from the biomarker FDA test table, where the ID is not equal to "FDA000303" and it matches with the biomarker FDA table.
(4) Retrieve the trade name of all tests in the biomarker FDA test table that are not associated with the FDA ID "FDA000303" in the biomarker FDA table.
(5) Find all test trade names from the biomarker_fda_test table that do not match with the test_trade_name column in the biomarker_fda table, except for "FDA000303".
(6) Get the trade names from the biomarker_fda_test table that are not equal to "FDA000303" from the biomarker_fda table.
(7) Find the test trade name from the FDA biomarker list where the ID is not "FDA000303".
