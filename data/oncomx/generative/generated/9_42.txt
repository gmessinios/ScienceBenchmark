Original Query:
SELECT T1.speciesid FROM species AS T1 JOIN xref_gene_ensembl AS T2 ON T1.speciesid = T2.speciesid WHERE T2.ensembl_gene_id != "ENSG00000049540"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) What are the species IDs for all species that have an Ensembl gene ID different from "ENSG00000049540" in the xref_gene_ensembl table?
(1) What is the species ID for all species that have an Ensembl gene ID different from "ENSG00000049540" in the xref_gene_ensembl table?
(2) Retrieve the species ID from the species table for all species where the ensembl_gene_id in the xref_gene_ensembl table is not equal to "ENSG00000049540" and join them with the xref_gene_ensembl table.
(3) Retrieve the species ID from the "species" table, joined with the "xref_gene_ensembl" table on matching species IDs, where the ensembl_gene_id in "xref_gene_ensembl" is not equal to "ENSG00000049540".
(4) Retrieve the species ID from the species table that is associated with an Ensembl gene ID in the xref_gene_ensembl table, excluding any entries where the Ensembl gene ID is "ENSG00000049540".
(5) Retrieve the species ID for all species that have an Ensembl gene ID not equal to "ENSG00000049540" in the table of cross-references between genes and Ensembl IDs.
(6) Retrieve the species ID from the species table for all entries where the Ensembl gene ID in the xref_gene_ensembl table is not "ENSG00000049540", while also joining these two tables together.
(7) What is the species ID for all species that have a gene listed in the xref_gene_ensembl table with an Ensembl gene ID that is not "ENSG00000049540"?
