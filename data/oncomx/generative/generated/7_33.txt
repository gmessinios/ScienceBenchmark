GPT-3 choices:
(0) What is the name of the anatomical entity or part of the cerebral cortex that processes visual information?
(1) What is the name of the anatomical entity that has an ID of "UBERON:0004913" or a description of "the part of the cerebral cortex responsible for processing visual information"?
(2) What is the name of the anatomical entity that corresponds to "UBERON:0004913" or has a description of "the part of the cerebral cortex responsible for processing visual information"?
(3) Get the name of the anatomical entity from the table "anatomical_entity" where its ID is "UBERON:0004913" or its description is "the part of the cerebral cortex responsible for processing visual information."
(4) What is the name of the anatomical entity or its description that corresponds to "the part of the cerebral cortex responsible for processing visual information"?
(5) What is the name of the anatomical entity that is either identified by "UBERON:0004913" or described as being responsible for processing visual information in the cerebral cortex?
(6) Retrieve the name of the anatomical entity from the UBERON database where the ID is "UBERON:0004913" or the description is "the part of the cerebral cortex responsible for processing visual information".
(7) What is the name of the anatomical entity or structure that corresponds to the UBERON ID "UBERON:0004913" or has a description of "the part of the cerebral cortex responsible for processing visual information"?
