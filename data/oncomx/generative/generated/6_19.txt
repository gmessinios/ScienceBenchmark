Original Query:
SELECT T1.doid FROM differential_expression AS T1 WHERE T1.subjects_nocoverage = 57 and T1.pvalue = 1.75e-133
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the Disease Ontology ID for differential expression data where there are 57 subjects with no coverage and a p-value of 1.75e-133.
(1) Retrieve the DOID from the differential expression data where there are 57 subjects with no coverage and a p-value of 1.75e-133.
(2) Retrieve the disease ID from the differential expression table where the number of subjects with no coverage is 57 and the p-value is equal to 1.75e-133.
(3) Retrieve the disease ID from differential expression data where the number of subjects without coverage is 57 and the p-value is equal to 1.75e-133.
(4) Find the Disease Ontology IDs for differential expressions where there are 57 subjects with no coverage and a p-value of 1.75e-133.
(5) Find the DOID from the differential_expression table where subjects_nocoverage is equal to 57 and pvalue is equal to 1.75e-133.
(6) Find the Disease Ontology IDs for differential expression data where there are 57 subjects with no coverage and a p-value of 1.75e-133.
(7) Retrieve the DOIDs from the differential_expression table where the number of subjects with no coverage is 57 and the p-value is equal to 1.75e-133.
