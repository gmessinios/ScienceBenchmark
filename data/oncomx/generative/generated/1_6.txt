Original Query:
SELECT T1.id FROM biomarker_fda AS T1 JOIN biomarker_fda_test AS T2 ON T1.test_trade_name = T2.test_trade_name WHERE T2.test_manufacturer = "THERASCREEN EGFR RGQ PCR KIT"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the ID numbers for all biomarkers listed in the FDA database that have a test trade name matching "THERASCREEN EGFR RGQ PCR KIT" and are manufactured by the company "THERASCREEN EGFR RGQ PCR KIT".
(1) What is the ID of all biomarkers from the FDA database that have a corresponding test trade name in the biomarker FDA test database with a manufacturer listed as "THERASCREEN EGFR RGQ PCR KIT"?
(2) Retrieve the ID from the biomarker_fda table for a test that is in both the biomarker_fda and biomarker_fda_test tables, with the test trade name being "THERASCREEN EGFR RGQ PCR KIT" and the test manufacturer also being "THERASCREEN EGFR RGQ PCR KIT".
(3) Retrieve the ID from the biomarker_fda table where the test_trade_name matches a test in the biomarker_fda_test table with a test_manufacturer of "THERASCREEN EGFR RGQ PCR KIT".
(4) "Find the id of biomarkers from the FDA database that have a test trade name matching one listed in the FDA biomarker test list with a manufacturer named "THERASCREEN EGFR RGQ PCR KIT"."
(5) Find the ID of biomarker_fda where the test trade name is equal to "THERASCREEN EGFR RGQ PCR KIT" and the test manufacturer is equal to "THERASCREEN EGFR RGQ PCR KIT".
(6) "Retrieve the ID of biomarkers from the FDA database that correspond to tests listed in the FDA biomarker test registry as THERASCREEN EGFR RGQ PCR KIT and are manufactured by a company listed in the manufacturer column."
(7) "Retrieve the ID of biomarkers from the FDA that have a corresponding test trade name in the biomarker FDA test database, with a test manufacturer of "THERASCREEN EGFR RGQ PCR KIT"."
