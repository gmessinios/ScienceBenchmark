Original Query:
SELECT T1.ref_aa FROM disease_mutation AS T1 JOIN disease_mutation_impact_prediction AS T2 ON T1.id = T2.disease_mutation_id WHERE T2.id != 9954
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the reference amino acid of disease mutations that have an impact prediction other than 9954 in the disease_mutation_impact_prediction table, joining with the disease_mutation table.
(1) Retrieve the reference amino acid from the disease mutation table, where the impact prediction id is not equal to 9954.
(2) Retrieve the reference amino acid from disease mutations that have an impact prediction, excluding those with an impact prediction ID of 9954.
(3) Retrieve the amino acid reference from disease_mutation where the ID is not equal to 9954 in the disease_mutation_impact_prediction table.
(4) What are the reference amino acids for all disease mutations that have a corresponding entry in the disease_mutation_impact_prediction table except for those with an id of 9954?
(5) Get the reference amino acid from the disease_mutation table where the id is not equal to 9954 in the disease_mutation_impact_prediction table.
(6) Find the amino acid reference for a disease mutation that has an impact prediction associated with it.
(7) Retrieve the reference amino acid from the disease_mutation table where the id in disease_mutation_impact_prediction is not equal to 9954.
