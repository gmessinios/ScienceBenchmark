Original Query:
SELECT T1.description FROM anatomical_entity AS T1 JOIN biomarker_edrn AS T2 ON T1.id = T2.uberon_anatomical_id WHERE T2.qa_state = "Under Review"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) What is the description of anatomical entities for which the QA state in biomarker_edrn is "Under Review"?
(1) Retrieve the description of anatomical entities that are associated with biomarkers currently under review in the EDRN database.
(2) What are the descriptions of anatomical entities that have a corresponding ID in the biomarker_edrn table and a QA state of "Under Review"?
(3) Retrieve the description of anatomical entities associated with biomarkers that are currently under review in the EDRN database.
(4) What are the descriptions of anatomical entities that are linked to biomarkers currently under review in the EDRN database?
(5) Get the description of the anatomical entity from the biomarker_edrn table where the QA state is "Under Review" and join it with the anatomical_entity table on matching IDs.
(6) What is the description of the anatomical entity associated with a biomarker in review?
(7) What are the descriptions of anatomical entities associated with biomarkers in a QA state of "Under Review" in the EDRN database?
