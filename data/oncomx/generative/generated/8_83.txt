GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the actual use for a biomarker FDA test that does not have a test submission with the ID "K062728".
(1) What is the actual use for biomarkers submitted to the FDA for testing, excluding test submission "K062728"?
(2) Retrieve the actual use of biomarker FDA tests from the table "biomarker_fda_test_use" where the test submission is not equal to "K062728".
(3) What are the actual uses for biomarker FDA test submissions, excluding "K062728"?
(4) Retrieve the actual use of biomarkers in FDA tests, excluding those with a test submission code of "K062728".
(5) What are the actual uses of FDA-approved biomarker tests in which the test submission is not equal to "K062728"?
(6) Get the actual use from the biomarker FDA test use table for all submissions except for "K062728".
(7) "What is the actual use of biomarker FDA test submissions that are not equal to "K062728" in the biomarker FDA test use table?"
