Original Query:
SELECT T1.speciesid FROM species AS T1 JOIN xref_gene_ensembl AS T2 ON T1.speciesid = T2.speciesid WHERE T2.gene_symbol != "1700125H03Rik"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Which species have a gene symbol that is not "1700125H03Rik" according to the xref_gene_ensembl table?
(1) Find the species IDs of all species that have a gene symbol in the xref_gene_ensembl table that is not equal to "1700125H03Rik".
(2) Retrieve the species ID for all species where the gene symbol is not "1700125H03Rik", by joining the tables "species" and "xref_gene_ensembl" on the common column of species ID.
(3) Retrieve the speciesid from the species table where the gene_symbol in the xref_gene_ensembl table is not equal to "1700125H03Rik".
(4) Find the species ID from the table "species" where the gene symbol in the table "xref_gene_ensembl" is not equal to "1700125H03Rik".
(5) Retrieve the species ID from the "species" table that is joined with the "xref_gene_ensembl" table, but only for entries where the gene symbol in "xref_gene_ensembl" is not equal to "1700125H03Rik".
(6) Retrieve the species ID from the species table where the gene symbol in the xref_gene_ensembl table is not equal to "1700125H03Rik".
(7) Find the species ID for all species where the gene symbol is not "1700125H03Rik" in the xref_gene_ensembl table, joined with the species table.
