Original Query:
SELECT T1.test_adoption_evidence, count(*) FROM biomarker_fda_test AS T1  GROUP BY T1.test_adoption_evidence
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the number of times each type of test adoption evidence appears in the biomarker_fda_test table.
(1) How many biomarker FDA tests are there for each type of test adoption evidence?
(2) How many biomarker FDA tests have been adopted and what is the number of instances for each type of adoption evidence?
(3) Count the number of entries in the "test_adoption_evidence" column of the "biomarker_fda_test" table and group them by the values in that column.
(4) "Find the number of occurrences for each type of test adoption evidence in the biomarker_fda_test table."
(5) How many instances are there of each type of test adoption evidence recorded in the biomarker_fda_test table?
(6) How many biomarker tests have been adopted based on FDA evidence, and how many are there for each type of test?
(7) Find the number of occurrences for each test adoption evidence in the biomarker_fda_test table.
