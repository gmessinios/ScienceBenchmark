Original Query:
SELECT T1.feature_key FROM disease_mutation_site_annotation AS T1 JOIN disease_mutation AS T2 ON T1.disease_mutation_id = T2.id WHERE T2.id != 12787
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the feature key of disease mutation sites from the disease mutation site annotation table where the corresponding disease mutation id is not 12787.
(1) Retrieve the feature key from the disease mutation site annotation table for all disease mutations that are not associated with the ID 12787.
(2) Get the feature keys from the disease mutation site annotations for all disease mutations except those with an ID of 12787.
(3) Get the feature keys from the disease mutation site annotation table for all disease mutations, excluding the one with an ID of 12787.
(4) Retrieve the feature keys from the disease mutation site annotation table for all disease mutations, excluding those with an ID of 12787.
(5) Retrieve the feature key from the disease mutation site annotation table for all disease mutations except for the one with an ID of 12787.
(6) Find the feature key from the disease mutation site annotation table for all disease mutations except for the one with ID 12787.
(7) Retrieve the feature keys from the disease mutation site annotations for all disease mutations, excluding those with an ID of 12787.
