GPT-3 choices:
(0) Get the anatomical entity ID from disease mutation tissue that is not "UBERON:0004262" and join it with the anatomical entity table.
(1) Find the UBERON anatomical IDs from the disease_mutation_tissue and anatomical_entity tables where the anatomical entity IDs are not equal to "UBERON:0004262".
(2) Find the Uberon anatomical IDs from the disease mutation tissue table where the ID is not equal to "UBERON:0004262" and join it with the anatomical entity table.
(3) Retrieve the uberon anatomical ID from the disease_mutation_tissue table for all entries where the uberon anatomical ID does not equal "UBERON:0004262" and join it with the anatomical_entity table on matching IDs.
(4) Retrieve the Uberon anatomical ID from the disease_mutation_tissue table, where the ID is not equal to "UBERON:0004262", and join it with the anatomical_entity table on matching IDs.
(5) Retrieve the uberon anatomical ID from the disease_mutation_tissue table where the uberon anatomical ID is not equal to "UBERON:0004262" and join it with the anatomical_entity table, excluding any results where the ID matches "UBERON:0004262".
(6) Find the anatomical entity IDs from the disease mutation tissue table where the uberon anatomical ID is not equal to "UBERON:0004262" and join them with the anatomical entity table.
(7) Retrieve the uberon anatomical ID from the disease mutation tissue table where the anatomical entity ID is not equal to "UBERON:0004262" and join it with the anatomical entity table.
