Original Query:
SELECT T1.gene_symbol FROM xref_gene_ensembl AS T1 JOIN species AS T2 ON T1.speciesid = T2.speciesid WHERE T2.genus != "Mus"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Get the gene symbol from the xref_gene_ensembl table for all species that are not of the genus "Mus".
(1) Retrieve the gene symbols from the table "xref_gene_ensembl" where the genus of the species is not equal to "Mus".
(2) Get the gene symbol from the xref_gene_ensembl table for species that are not in the genus "Mus".
(3) Get the gene symbols from xref_gene_ensembl for species that are not part of the "Mus" genus by joining with the species table.
(4) Find all gene symbols from the xref_gene_ensembl table for species that do not belong to the genus "Mus".
(5) Retrieve all gene symbols from the Ensembl cross-reference database for species that are not of the genus Mus.
(6) Find the gene symbols for all species in the xref_gene_ensembl table except those belonging to the genus Mus.
(7) Retrieve the gene symbol from the table xref_gene_ensembl where the species is not "Mus".
