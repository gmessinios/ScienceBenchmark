GPT-3 choices:
(0) What is the ID of all biomarkers in the FDA database that have associated NCIt terms, excluding those with an ID of "FDA000119"?
(1) Find the IDs of all biomarkers in the FDA database that have a NCIt term associated with them, excluding the biomarker with ID "FDA000119".
(2) What is the ID for all biomarkers in the FDA database that have an associated NCIt term, except for biomarker "FDA000119"?
(3) Get the ID of all biomarkers from the FDA that have an NCIT term associated with them, except for "FDA000119".
(4) Retrieve the id from the biomarker_fda table where the corresponding id in the biomarker_fda_ncit_term table is not equal to "FDA000119".
(5) Get the id from the biomarker_fda table where the biomarker_fda_ncit_term table has an entry with a different id than "FDA000119".
(6) What are the IDs of all biomarkers in the FDA database that have at least one associated NCIt term and exclude any biomarkers with the ID "FDA000119"?
(7) Find all the IDs from the biomarker_fda table that have an associated ID in the biomarker_fda_ncit_term table where the NCIt term is not "FDA000119".
