Original Query:
SELECT T1.doid FROM cancer_tissue AS T1 WHERE T1.uberon_anatomical_id != "UBERON:0002107"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the disease ontology identifiers for cancer tissue from the database "cancer_tissue" where the Uberon anatomical identifier is not equal to "UBERON:0002107".
(1) Retrieve the disease ontology identifier from the cancer_tissue table where the Uberon anatomical ID is not equal to "UBERON:0002107".
(2) Retrieve the disease ontology ID for cancer tissues that do not have a corresponding Uberon anatomical ID.
(3) What are the disease ontology IDs from the cancer tissue table where the Uberon anatomical ID is not "UBERON:0002107"?
(4) What is the disease ontology identifier for cancer tissues that have a corresponding Uberon anatomical identifier other than "UBERON:0002107"?
(5) Find the disease ontology ID from the table "cancer_tissue" where the Uberon anatomical ID is not equal to "UBERON:0002107".
(6) Retrieve the Disease Ontology IDs for cancer tissues from the Cancer Tissue table, excluding those with a corresponding Uberon anatomical ID of "UBERON:0002107".
(7) Find the Disease Ontology (DOID) codes from the cancer_tissue table where the Uberon anatomical ID is not equal to "UBERON:0002107".
