Original Query:
SELECT T1.biomarker_internal_id FROM biomarker_article AS T1 JOIN biomarker AS T2 ON T1.biomarker_internal_id = T2.id WHERE T2.test_is_a_panel = False
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the internal IDs of all biomarkers from articles where the corresponding biomarker is not a panel test.
(1) Retrieve the internal IDs of biomarkers from the table biomarker_article where the test_is_a_panel value for each biomarker is False and join it with the table biomarker using their common ID.
(2) Retrieve the internal ID of biomarkers from articles that are not part of a panel test.
(3) Retrieve the internal ID of biomarkers from the table biomarker_article where the corresponding biomarker is not a panel test.
(4) Find the internal IDs of biomarkers that are not part of a panel in the biomarker article table, joining it with the biomarker table.
(5) Retrieve the internal IDs of biomarkers from the article and biomarker tables where the biomarker is not a panel test.
(6) Retrieve the internal IDs of biomarkers from the article table for biomarkers that are not a panel in the biomarker table.
(7) Find the internal IDs for biomarkers that are not panels from articles associated with those biomarkers.
