SELECT biomarker_fda_ncit_term.biomarker_fda_id FROM biomarker_fda_ncit_term AS biomarker_fda_ncit_term WHERE biomarker_fda_ncit_term.ncit_biomarker = "MET"

###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.biomarker_fda_id FROM biomarker_fda_ncit_term AS T1 WHERE T1.ncit_biomarker = "MET"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) What is the biomarker FDA ID for the biomarker NCIT term where the NCIT biomarker is "MET"?
(1) What is the FDA biomarker ID for the term "MET" in the NCIT biomarker database?
(2) What is the biomarker FDA ID for the biomarker that has an NCIt term of "MET"?
(3) What is the biomarker FDA ID for the NCIt biomarker "MET"?
(4) Find the FDA biomarker ID for the term "MET" in the table biomarker_fda_ncit_term.
(5) What is the biomarker FDA ID for "MET" in the biomarker FDA NCIT term database?
(6) Retrieve the biomarker FDA ID from the biomarker_fda_ncit_term table where the NCIT biomarker is equal to "MET".
(7) What is the FDA biomarker ID for the NCIt biomarker "MET"?
