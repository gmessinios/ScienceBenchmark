SELECT disease_mutation.ref_nt FROM disease_mutation AS disease_mutation WHERE disease_mutation.data_source = "clinvar" or disease_mutation.peptide_pos = 438

###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.ref_nt FROM disease_mutation AS T1 WHERE T1.data_source = "clinvar" or T1.peptide_pos = 438
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the reference nucleotide from disease mutations where the data source is "clinvar" or the peptide position is 438.
(1) What is the reference nucleotide for disease mutations in position 438 that are sourced from ClinVar?
(2) Retrieve the reference nucleotide from the disease_mutation table where the data source is equal to "clinvar" or the peptide position is equal to 438.
(3) What is the reference nucleotide for the disease mutation with either a data source of "clinvar" or a peptide position of 438?
(4) What is the reference nucleotide for a disease mutation with either a data source of ClinVar or a peptide position of 438?
(5) Get the reference nucleotide from the disease mutation data where the data source is "clinvar" or the peptide position is 438.
(6) Retrieve the reference nucleotide from the disease_mutation table where either the data_source is "clinvar" or the peptide position is 438.
(7) Find the reference nucleotide for disease mutations where the data source is "clinvar" or the peptide position is 438.
