GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the PMIDs of biomarker articles where the biomarker internal ID is not equal to "EDRN00706".
(1) What is the PMID of articles that contain a biomarker internal ID other than "EDRN00706"?
(2) Find the PubMed ID of articles that have a biomarker internal ID different from "EDRN00706".
(3) Retrieve the PubMed ID of articles in which biomarkers have been mentioned, excluding articles where the biomarker has an internal ID of "EDRN00706".
(4) Retrieve the PubMed ID of articles that mention biomarkers, excluding those with the internal ID "EDRN00706".
(5) Retrieve the PMID of all articles in which the biomarker internal ID is not "EDRN00706".
(6) What are the PMID numbers for articles that mention a biomarker with an internal ID other than "EDRN00706" in the biomarker_article table?
(7) Retrieve the PMID numbers of articles that contain a biomarker different from "EDRN00706" in the biomarker_article table.
