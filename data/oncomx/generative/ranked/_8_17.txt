###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.biomarker_origin FROM biomarker_fda_test AS T1 WHERE T1.test_manufacturer != "23andMe"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) "Retrieve the origin of biomarkers from the FDA that are not manufactured by 23andMe."
(1) What is the origin of biomarkers from FDA tests that were not manufactured by "23andMe"?
(2) What is the origin of biomarkers from the biomarker_fda_test table where the test manufacturer is not "23andMe"?
(3) "Retrieve the origin of biomarkers from FDA-approved tests, excluding any that were manufactured by 23andMe."
(4) Retrieve the origin of all biomarkers from FDA-approved tests that were not manufactured by 23andMe.
(5) Find the origin of biomarkers that are not manufactured by 23andMe in the biomarker_fda_test table.
(6) What is the biomarker origin for all entries in the biomarker_fda_test table, where the test manufacturer is not equal to "23andMe"?
(7) "What is the origin of the biomarker from the FDA test if it was not manufactured by 23andMe?"
