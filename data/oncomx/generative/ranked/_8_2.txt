###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.clinical_significance FROM biomarker_fda_test AS T1 WHERE T1.doid != 10283
GPT-3 choices:
(0) What are the clinical significances for biomarkers in the biomarker_fda_test table where doid is not equal to 10283?
(1) Find the clinical significance of biomarkers in biomarker_fda_test table where the disease is not equal to prostate cancer (doid != 10283).
(2) Retrieve the clinical significance for all biomarkers in the FDA test that do not have a Disease Ontology ID of 10283.
(3) Find the clinical significance from the biomarker_fda_test table where doid is not equal to 10283.
(4) What is the clinical significance of biomarkers in diseases other than celiac disease?
(5) What is the clinical significance of biomarkers that are not associated with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy?
(6) What is the clinical significance of biomarkers in the FDA database, excluding those related to Hodgkin's lymphoma?
(7) Retrieve the clinical significance of biomarkers from the FDA database for all diseases except Crohn's disease.
