GPT-3 choices:
(0) What is the UniProtKB accession number for all protein-disease-mutation mappings, excluding those with a peptide ID of "ENSP00000226253"?
(1) Find the UniProtKB accession numbers from the map_protein_disease_mutation table where the peptide_id is not "ENSP00000226253".
(2) Retrieve the UniProtKB accession number for proteins associated with a disease and mutation, excluding those related to the ENSP00000226253 peptide.
(3) Find the UniProtKB accessions for protein-disease-mutation mappings where the peptide ID is not "ENSP00000226253".
(4) Retrieve the UniprotKB accession code for proteins associated with disease mutations that are not linked to the peptide ID "ENSP00000226253".
(5) Get all the UniProtKB accession numbers from the map_protein_disease_mutation table where the peptide_id is not equal to "ENSP00000226253".
(6) Retrieve the UniProtKB accession number from the map_protein_disease_mutation table where the peptide_id is not "ENSP00000226253".
(7) Retrieve the UniprotKB accession number from the map_protein_disease_mutation table where the peptide_id is not equal to "ENSP00000226253".
