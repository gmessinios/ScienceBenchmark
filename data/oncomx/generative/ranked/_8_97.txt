Original Query:
SELECT T1.doid FROM cancer_tissue AS T1 WHERE T1.uberon_anatomical_id != "UBERON:0002046"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the disease ontology IDs from the cancer_tissue table where the associated Uberon anatomical ID is not equal to "UBERON:0002046".
(1) Retrieve the Disease Ontology IDs from the cancer_tissue table where the Uberon anatomical ID is not equal to "UBERON:0002046".
(2) Retrieve the disease ontology identifier from cancer tissue data where the Uberon anatomical ID is not equal to "UBERON:0002046".
(3) Find the DOID for cancer tissues that do not have a UBERON anatomical ID of "UBERON:0002046".
(4) Get the disease ontology ID for cancer tissues from the table cancer_tissue, excluding those with an Uberon anatomical ID of "UBERON:0002046".
(5) Get the disease ontology ID from the cancer_tissue table where the uberon anatomical ID is not equal to "UBERON:0002046".
(6) Find the disease ontology IDs from the cancer_tissue table where the anatomical ID is not equal to "UBERON:0002046".
(7) Find the Disease Ontology IDs for all cancer tissues that do not have the Uberon anatomical ID "UBERON:0002046".
