Original Query:
SELECT T1.name FROM stage AS T1 JOIN healthy_expression AS T2 ON T1.id = T2.uberon_developmental_id WHERE T2.expression_rank_score != 90.20
GPT-3 choices:
(0) "Retrieve the name of all stages where the expression rank score for healthy expressions in the corresponding uberon developmental ID is not equal to 90.20."
(1) Find the names of all stages where the expression rank score for healthy expression is not 90.20 in the stage table joined with the healthy_expression table on the developmental ID matching between both tables.
(2) Retrieve the names of all stages from the stage table that have a corresponding developmental ID in the healthy_expression table, but do not have an expression rank score of 90.20 in the healthy_expression table.
(3) What is the name of each stage that is joined with the healthy expression table on its ID and has a rank score for expression that is not equal to 90.20?
(4) Retrieve the name of all stages from the stage table that have a corresponding entry in the healthy_expression table, but with an expression_rank_score that is not equal to 90.20.
(5) Retrieve the names of all stages where there is a mismatch between the expression rank score and 90.20 for healthy expressions in developmental ontology data.
(6) What are the names of stages where healthy expression is not ranked at 90.20?
(7) Find the names of stages that are associated with healthy expression data, excluding any stage where the expression rank score is 90.20.
