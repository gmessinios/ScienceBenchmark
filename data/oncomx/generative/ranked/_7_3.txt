###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.biomarker_type FROM biomarker_edrn AS T1 WHERE T1.uberon_anatomical_id = "UBERON:0002048" or T1.phase = "Two"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find all biomarker types from the database biomarker_edrn where the anatomical ID is "UBERON:0002048" or the phase is "Two".
(1) Retrieve the biomarker type from the EDRN database for any biomarkers with a UBERON anatomical ID of "UBERON:0002048" or a phase of "Two".
(2) Retrieve the biomarker type from the biomarker_edrn table where the uberon_anatomical_id is "UBERON:0002048" or the phase is "Two".
(3) Retrieve the biomarker types from the EDRN biomarker database for which the corresponding Uberon anatomical ID is "UBERON:0002048" or phase is "Two".
(4) Retrieve the biomarker type from the biomarker_edrn table where the uberon_anatomical_id is equal to "UBERON:0002048" or the phase is equal to "Two".
(5) Retrieve the type of biomarker from the table "biomarker_edrn" where the anatomical ID is "UBERON:0002048" or the phase is "Two".
(6) Retrieve the biomarker type from the EDRN biomarker database for biomarkers associated with the UBERON anatomical ID "UBERON:0002048" or in Phase Two of development.
(7) Which biomarker types are associated with the anatomical location UBERON:0002048 or phase Two in the EDRN database?
