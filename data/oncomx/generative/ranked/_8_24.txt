Original Query:
SELECT T1.disease_mutation_id FROM disease_mutation_tissue AS T1 WHERE T1.uberon_anatomical_id != "UBERON:0001833"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the disease mutation IDs from the disease_mutation_tissue table where the uberon_anatomical_id is not "UBERON:0001833".
(1) What are the disease mutation IDs that do not have an associated UBERON anatomical ID of "UBERON:0001833"?
(2) Find the disease mutation IDs for which there is a corresponding tissue with an anatomical ID that is not "UBERON:0001833".
(3) Find the disease mutation IDs from the disease_mutation_tissue table where the uberon_anatomical_id is not "UBERON:0001833".
(4) Find the disease mutation IDs from the table "disease_mutation_tissue" where the UBERON anatomical ID is not equal to "UBERON:0001833".
(5) Find all disease-mutation IDs from the disease_mutation_tissue table where the UBERON anatomical ID is not "UBERON:0001833".
(6) Find all disease mutation IDs from the table disease_mutation_tissue where the corresponding uberon_anatomical_id is not "UBERON:0001833".
(7) Find the disease mutation IDs from the table disease_mutation_tissue where the associated anatomical identifier is not "UBERON:0001833".
