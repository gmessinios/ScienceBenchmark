###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.id FROM biomarker_edrn AS T1 WHERE T1.biomarker_type = "Gene" or T1.qa_state = "Accepted"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the ID of biomarkers from the EDRN database that are either genes or have been accepted in quality assurance.
(1) Find the ID of biomarker_edrn where the biomarker type is "Gene" or the QA state is "Accepted".
(2) Retrieve the identification numbers of all biomarkers from the EDRN database that have a type of "Gene" or are in a state of "Accepted".
(3) Find the ID numbers of all biomarkers from the EDRN database that have a type of "Gene" or are in an accepted quality assurance state.
(4) What are the IDs of biomarkers that have a type of "Gene" or have a QA state of "Accepted" in the biomarker_edrn table?
(5) Retrieve the IDs from the biomarker_edrn table where either the biomarker_type is "Gene" or the qa_state is "Accepted".
(6) Find the ID numbers for biomarkers in the EDRN database that are either categorized as "Gene" or have a quality assurance state of "Accepted".
(7) Retrieve the IDs from the biomarker_edrn table where the biomarker type is "Gene" or the QA state is "Accepted".
