Original Query:
SELECT T1.speciescommonname FROM species AS T1 JOIN xref_gene_ensembl AS T2 ON T1.speciesid = T2.speciesid WHERE T2.speciesid != 9606
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the common names of all species that do not have a species ID of 9606 in the xref_gene_ensembl table.
(1) Which species have a common name that is not "Human"?
(2) Find the common names of all species from the xref_gene_ensembl table, excluding those with a species ID of 9606.
(3) Which species' common names are not "Homo sapiens"?
(4) Retrieve the common names of all species from the "species" table, excluding those with a species ID of 9606, which can be found in both the "species" and "xref_gene_ensembl" tables.
(5) Get the common names of all species that are not Homo sapiens, but have corresponding entries in the xref_gene_ensembl table.
(6) List all common names of species that are not human and have an Ensembl gene ID associated with them.
(7) What are the common names of species that have a different ID than 9606 in the xref_gene_ensembl table, and what is their corresponding species ID?
