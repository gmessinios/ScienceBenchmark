GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the UniProt canonical IDs of proteins that have mutations associated with diseases, but do not include any proteins with the peptide ID "ENSP00000217428".
(1) Find the UniProt canonical ID for proteins that have a mapped protein-disease mutation and are not associated with the peptide ID "ENSP00000217428".
(2) Retrieve the UniprotKB canonical ID from the table map_uniprot_canonical_id where the peptide ID in the table map_protein_disease_mutation is not equal to "ENSP00000217428".
(3) Find the UniProtKB accession IDs for proteins that have mutations associated with a disease, but are not the same protein as ENSP00000217428.
(4) Retrieve the canonical UniProtKB accession numbers from the mapping table where the peptide ID is not equal to "ENSP00000217428" in the protein-disease-mutation mapping table.
(5) "Retrieve the UniprotKB canonical ID for proteins associated with disease mutations, excluding those corresponding to the peptide ID 'ENSP00000217428'."
(6) Retrieve the Uniprot canonical IDs from the table map_uniprot_canonical_id for all entries in which the uniprotkb_ac column matches with the peptide_id column of the table map_protein_disease_mutation, except for entries where peptide_id is equal to "ENSP00000217428".
(7) Retrieve the UniProtKB accession numbers from the map_uniprot_canonical_id table for all entries in the map_protein_disease_mutation table where the peptide_id is not "ENSP00000217428".
