###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.disease_mutation_id FROM disease_mutation_article AS T1 JOIN disease_mutation AS T2 ON T1.disease_mutation_id = T2.id WHERE T2.ref_nt != "T"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the disease mutation IDs from the articles for which the corresponding disease mutation's reference nucleotide is not "T".
(1) Retrieve the disease mutation IDs from articles associated with disease mutations that have a reference nucleotide other than "T".
(2) Retrieve the disease mutation IDs from the table "disease_mutation_article" where the reference nucleotide in the corresponding row of table "disease_mutation" is not equal to "T".
(3) Retrieve the disease mutation IDs from the disease mutation article table where the referenced nucleotide in the corresponding disease mutation is not equal to "T".
(4) Retrieve the disease mutation IDs from the disease_mutation_article table where the corresponding entry in the disease_mutation table has a reference nucleotide other than "T".
(5) Find the disease-mutation IDs of articles related to disease mutations where the reference nucleotide is not equal to "T".
(6) Find the IDs of all disease-mutation pairs where the reference nucleotide is not equal to "T".
(7) Retrieve the disease mutation IDs from the disease mutation articles table where the reference nucleotide in the corresponding disease mutation is not "T".
