Original Query:
SELECT T1.speciesid FROM xref_gene_ensembl AS T1 JOIN healthy_expression AS T2 ON T1.ensembl_gene_id = T2.ensembl_gene_id WHERE T2.call_quality != "SILVER"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the speciesid from the xref_gene_ensembl table where the ensembl_gene_id matches that in the healthy_expression table, but only include rows where the call_quality is not "SILVER".
(1) Find the species IDs from the table "xref_gene_ensembl" that correspond to genes in the table "healthy_expression" with a call quality that is not "SILVER".
(2) Retrieve the species ID from the cross-reference table between Ensembl gene IDs and gene expression data for healthy samples, where the call quality in the gene expression data is not "SILVER".
(3) Retrieve the species ID from the table containing cross-referenced gene IDs and Ensembl gene IDs, for those entries where the call quality in a separate table of healthy expression data is not "SILVER".
(4) Get the species ID from the xref_gene_ensembl table for all genes in the healthy_expression table that have a call quality other than "SILVER".
(5) What are the species IDs for all genes in the healthy_expression table that have a call quality other than "SILVER" in the xref_gene_ensembl table?
(6) Find the speciesid for each ensembl gene in the xref_gene_ensembl table that matches with the ensembl gene id in the healthy_expression table, where the call_quality is not "SILVER".
(7) Find the species ID of all genes in the xref_gene_ensembl table that have a corresponding entry in the healthy_expression table where the call quality is not "SILVER".
