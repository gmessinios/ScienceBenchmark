Original Query:
SELECT T1.tool FROM disease_mutation_impact_prediction AS T1 JOIN disease_mutation AS T2 ON T1.disease_mutation_id = T2.id WHERE T2.alt_aa != "M"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the tool used for predicting the impact of a mutation in a disease from the database for all disease mutations with an alternative amino acid that is not "M".
(1) Find the tool used for predicting the impact of mutations associated with diseases, excluding mutations where the alternate amino acid is not "M".
(2) Find the tool used in disease mutation impact prediction for all mutations where the alternate amino acid is not "M".
(3) Retrieve the tool used for predicting the impact of a disease mutation from the database, where the alternative amino acid is not equal to "M".
(4) Find the tool used in predicting the impact of mutations on diseases for all disease-mutation pairs where the alternate amino acid is not "M".
(5) What are the tools used for disease mutation impact prediction where the alternative amino acid is not "M"?
(6) Retrieve the tools used for predicting the impact of mutations in diseases where the alternate amino acid is not "M".
(7) What are the names of tools used in predicting the impact of mutations on diseases, for cases where the mutated amino acid is not methionine?
