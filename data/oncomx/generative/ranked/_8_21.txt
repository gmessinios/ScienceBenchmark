###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.uberon_anatomical_id FROM disease_mutation_tissue AS T1 WHERE T1.disease_mutation_id != 13679
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Get the unique UBeron anatomical IDs from the disease_mutation_tissue table where the disease_mutation_id is not equal to 13679.
(1) Retrieve the anatomical ID from the disease_mutation_tissue table for all entries except those with a disease mutation ID of 13679.
(2) What are the uberon anatomical IDs for all diseases and mutations, excluding the disease mutation with an ID of 13679?
(3) Find the uberon anatomical ID of all disease-mutation-tissue associations where the disease mutation ID is not equal to 13679.
(4) What is the anatomical identifier for tissues that are associated with disease mutations, excluding those related to a specific disease mutation ID?
(5) Find the anatomical IDs from disease_mutation_tissue where the disease mutation ID is not equal to 13679.
(6) Find the anatomical identifier from the "uberon_anatomical_id" column in the table "disease_mutation_tissue" for all rows except those with a "disease_mutation_id" value of 13679.
(7) Get the uberon anatomical ID from the disease mutation tissue table where the disease mutation ID is not equal to 13679.
