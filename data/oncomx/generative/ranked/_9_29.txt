GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the biomarker FDA ID for terms from the biomarker FDA NCIT term table, where the test submission is not equal to "K062700" in the biomarker FDA table.
(1) "Find the ID for biomarker FDA NCIT terms associated with biomarker FDA submissions that are not equal to 'K062700'."
(2) Find all the biomarker FDA NCIT terms associated with FDA biomarkers that have a test submission code other than "K062700".
(3) Retrieve the FDA biomarker IDs from the table containing NCIT terms associated with them, excluding any that have a test submission code of "K062700".
(4) Find all the biomarker FDA IDs from the table "biomarker_fda_ncit_term" where the test submission in the table "biomarker_fda" is not equal to "K062700".
(5) Find the biomarker FDA ID from the table "biomarker_fda_ncit_term" where the test submission is not equal to "K062700" and join it with the biomarker FDA table on their respective IDs.
(6) Find the biomarker FDA IDs from the table of biomarker FDA and NCIT term where the test submission is not equal to "K062700".
(7) What are the biomarker FDA IDs from the table "biomarker_fda_ncit_term" that have a test submission not equal to "K062700" in the table "biomarker_fda"?
