Original Query:
SELECT T1.disease_mutation_id FROM disease_mutation_tissue AS T1 WHERE T1.uberon_anatomical_id = "UBERON:0000467"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the disease mutation IDs associated with tissue samples from the uterine cervix.
(1) Retrieve the disease mutation ID from the disease_mutation_tissue table where the uberon_anatomical_id is equal to "UBERON:0000467".
(2) Retrieve the disease mutation IDs associated with the tissue located in the uterine tube (UBERON:0000467).
(3) "Find the disease mutation IDs associated with a specific tissue represented by UBERON:0000467 in the disease_mutation_tissue table."
(4) Get the disease mutation IDs from the table "disease_mutation_tissue" where the anatomical ID is "UBERON:0000467".
(5) Get the disease mutation IDs from the table "disease_mutation_tissue" where the uberon_anatomical_id is equal to "UBERON:0000467".
(6) What are the disease mutation IDs associated with tissues that have a UBERON anatomical ID of "UBERON:0000467"?
(7) Find the disease-mutation IDs from the table disease_mutation_tissue where the uberon_anatomical_id is "UBERON:0000467".
