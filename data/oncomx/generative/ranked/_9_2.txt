Original Query:
SELECT T1.id FROM stage AS T1 JOIN healthy_expression AS T2 ON T1.id = T2.uberon_developmental_id WHERE T2.call_quality != "BRONZE"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the IDs of stages where healthy expression data is available and the call quality is not "BRONZE" in the developmental stage.
(1) Retrieve the ID of all stages from the stage table, where the developmental ID in the healthy_expression table matches with the ID in the stage table and the call quality is not equal to "BRONZE" in the healthy_expression table.
(2) Retrieve the ID of each stage where the call quality for healthy expression is not "BRONZE" in the uberon developmental ontology.
(3) Retrieve the ID from the stage table where it joins with the healthy_expression table on matching IDs and the call quality is not "BRONZE".
(4) Retrieve the id of stages that are associated with healthy expression data and have a call quality that is not equal to "BRONZE".
(5) Find all stages in the stage table where there is a matching ID in the healthy_expression table and the call_quality column does not equal "BRONZE".
(6) Find the stage IDs from the stage table where the ID matches with the developmental ID in the healthy_expression table and excludes any rows where the call quality is not "BRONZE".
(7) Get the ID of all stages where the call quality in the healthy_expression table is not "BRONZE" and is associated with an uberon_developmental_id in both the stage and healthy_expression tables.
