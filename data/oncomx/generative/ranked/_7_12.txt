Original Query:
SELECT T1.ensembl_gene_id FROM healthy_expression AS T1 WHERE T1.expression_level_anatomical_relative = "HIGH" or T1.expression_score = 8.10000
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the Ensembl gene ID from the Healthy Expression table for genes with either a high expression level in an anatomical location or a score of 8.1.
(1) Retrieve the Ensembl gene ID from the healthy_expression table where the expression level in a specific anatomical location is considered high or the overall expression score is equal to 8.1.
(2) Find the Ensembl gene IDs from the Healthy Expression table where either the anatomical expression level is considered high or the expression score is equal to 8.1.
(3) "Retrieve the Ensembl gene ID from healthy expression where either the anatomical relative expression level is high or the expression score is 8.1."
(4) Retrieve the Ensembl gene ID from healthy expression where the expression level in an anatomical relative is "HIGH" or the expression score is 8.1.
(5) Find the Ensembl gene IDs for genes with either a high expression level relative to anatomical location or an expression score of 8.1 in the healthy_expression table.
(6) Retrieve the Ensembl gene ID from the healthy_expression table where the expression level anatomically is "HIGH" or the expression score is 8.1.
(7) Find the Ensembl gene IDs from healthy expression data where the expression level is either "HIGH" or the expression score is equal to 8.10000.
