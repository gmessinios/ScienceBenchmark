###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.aa_pos_uniprotkb FROM disease_mutation AS T1 WHERE T1.ref_aa != "W"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) What is the amino acid position in UniprotKB for disease mutations where the reference amino acid is not "W"?
(1) Get the amino acid position in the UniProtKB for disease mutations where the reference amino acid is not "W".
(2) Retrieve the amino acid position from disease mutations where the reference amino acid is not "W".
(3) What are the amino acid positions in UniProtKB for disease mutations where the reference amino acid is not "W"?
(4) Retrieve the amino acid position in UniProtKB for disease mutations where the reference amino acid is not "W".
(5) Find all the amino acid positions in the disease_mutation table where the reference amino acid is not "W".
(6) What is the amino acid position in UniProtKB for disease mutations that do not have a reference amino acid of "W"?
(7) Retrieve the amino acid position from the disease mutation table where the reference amino acid is not "W".
