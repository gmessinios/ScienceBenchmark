Original Query:
SELECT T1.uberon_anatomical_id FROM disease_mutation_tissue AS T1 JOIN disease_mutation AS T2 ON T1.disease_mutation_id = T2.id WHERE T2.data_source = "civic"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the anatomical IDs for tissues associated with mutations in diseases found in the CIViC data source.
(1) Get the unique anatomical IDs for all disease-mutation-tissue associations from CIViC data.
(2) Find the uberon anatomical ID for disease mutation tissues where the data source is "civic".
(3) Retrieve the anatomical IDs from the UBeron ontology for tissues associated with mutations in diseases, specifically those found in the CIViC data source.
(4) Get the UBERON anatomical ID of tissues from disease-mutation associations where the data source is "civic" in the CIViC database.
(5) Find the unique anatomical IDs for tissues related to disease mutations sourced from CIViC.
(6) Retrieve the UBeron anatomical IDs for disease-mutation-tissue associations in the CIViC data source.
(7) Retrieve the Uberon anatomical ID from the disease mutation tissue table for all disease mutations in the disease mutation table that are from the data source CIViC.
