SELECT biomarker_article.pmid FROM biomarker_article AS biomarker_article JOIN biomarker AS biomarker ON biomarker_article.biomarker_internal_id = biomarker.id WHERE biomarker.biomarker_description != "S100 calcium binding protein B"

###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.pmid FROM biomarker_article AS T1 JOIN biomarker AS T2 ON T1.biomarker_internal_id = T2.id WHERE T2.biomarker_description != "S100 calcium binding protein B"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the PubMed ID of articles that mention a biomarker, excluding those where the biomarker is described as "S100 calcium binding protein B".
(1) Find the PMID values from biomarker_article for all articles where the biomarker description is not "S100 calcium binding protein B" and the biomarker_internal_id is equal to the id value in biomarker.
(2) Retrieve the PubMed IDs of all articles that mention a biomarker, except those that refer to S100 calcium binding protein B.
(3) Retrieve the PMID numbers of articles associated with biomarkers that are not "S100 calcium binding protein B".
(4) Find the PubMed IDs for articles that mention a biomarker that is not "S100 calcium binding protein B".
(5) Retrieve the PubMed IDs from articles where the biomarker description is not "S100 calcium binding protein B".
(6) Find the PMID numbers for articles where the biomarker's description is not "S100 calcium binding protein B".
(7) Find the PubMed ID for articles that mention a biomarker other than "S100 calcium binding protein B".
