###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.test_approval_status FROM biomarker_fda_test AS T1 WHERE T1.biomarker_origin = "somatic mutation"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the test approval status for all biomarkers with a somatic mutation origin from the FDA test data.
(1) What is the FDA approval status of all somatic mutation biomarkers in the biomarker_fda_test database?
(2) Retrieve the approval status for a test from the biomarker_fda_test table where the biomarker origin is "somatic mutation".
(3) Retrieve the approval status of all biomarker FDA tests that have a somatic mutation as their origin.
(4) What is the test approval status of somatic mutation biomarkers in the biomarker_fda_test database?
(5) Retrieve the test approval status from the FDA for somatic mutation biomarkers.
(6) What is the FDA approval status for biomarker tests associated with somatic mutations?
(7) What is the approval status of tests for biomarkers that originate from somatic mutations in the FDA database?
