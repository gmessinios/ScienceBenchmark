Original Query:
SELECT T1.subjects_up FROM differential_expression AS T1 JOIN disease AS T2 ON T1.doid = T2.id WHERE T2.id = 1324
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the names of subjects with increased gene expression for a disease with an ID of 1324.
(1) Retrieve the subjects that have an upregulated differential expression in studies where the associated disease has a DOID identifier of 1324.
(2) Retrieve the list of subjects with up-regulated gene expression from the differential expression table for the disease with ID 1324, as identified in the disease table by joining on matching IDs.
(3) Retrieve the subjects with up-regulated differential expression for a disease with an ID of 1324 from the differential_expression table, joining on the disease table where the disease's ID matches the given ID.
(4) Retrieve the subjects with up-regulated differential expression values from the table "differential_expression" for all diseases that have an ID of 1324 in the table "disease".
(5) Get the subjects that have increased gene expression in differential expression data associated with the disease with ID 1324, as specified by joining the tables "differential_expression" and "disease" on matching disease IDs.
(6) Retrieve the list of subjects that have up-regulated genes in differential expression data for the disease with an ID of 1324 from the disease database.
(7) Retrieve the list of subjects who have an increase in gene expression associated with disease ID 1324, joined from the tables "differential_expression" and "disease".
