GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the UniProtKB accession number from the map_uniprot_canonical_id table for all rows where the UniProtKB accession number in the map_protein_disease_mutation table does not equal "ENSP00000025008".
(1) Retrieve the UniProt canonical ID for all proteins that have a mutation associated with a disease, excluding those with the peptide ID "ENSP00000025008".
(2) Retrieve the UniProtKB accessions from the Map_UniProt_Canonical_ID table that are also present in the Map_Protein_Disease_Mutation table, where the peptide ID is not "ENSP00000025008".
(3) Retrieve the Uniprot canonical IDs from the map_uniprot_canonical_id table for proteins associated with disease mutations in the map_protein_disease_mutation table, excluding those associated with peptide ID ENSP00000025008.
(4) Retrieve the UniProt canonical ID for all protein-disease mutations that are not associated with the peptide ID "ENSP00000025008".
(5) Find all the UniProtKB Accession IDs from the map_uniprot_canonical_id table where the uniprotkb_ac column is equal to the uniprotkb_ac column in the map_protein_disease_mutation table, and where the peptide_id column in the map_protein_disease_mutation table is not equal to "ENSP00000025008".
(6) Retrieve the UniprotKB accession numbers for canonical IDs that have mutations associated with diseases, excluding those with a peptide ID of "ENSP00000025008".
(7) Retrieve the UniProt canonical ID for proteins that are associated with mutations in diseases, excluding those with a specific peptide ID.
