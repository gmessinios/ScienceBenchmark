###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.peptide_pos, count(*) FROM disease_mutation AS T1  GROUP BY T1.peptide_pos
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Count the number of occurrences of each peptide position in the disease_mutation table and group them together by peptide position.
(1) How many instances of peptide positions are there in the disease_mutation table and what is the count for each position?
(2) What is the count of disease mutations grouped by peptide position?
(3) Find the count of occurrences for each unique peptide position in the "disease_mutation" table.
(4) Count the number of occurrences for each peptide position in the table "disease_mutation".
(5) What is the count of occurrences of each unique peptide position in the "disease_mutation" table?
(6) Count the number of occurrences in the table "disease_mutation" for each unique value in the column "peptide_pos".
(7) Count the number of occurrences of each peptide position in the disease_mutation table.
