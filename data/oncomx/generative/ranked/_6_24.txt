Original Query:
SELECT T1.subjects_up FROM differential_expression AS T1 WHERE T1.subjects_nochange = 48 and T1.expression_change_direction = "down"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the number of subjects that had an expression change in a downward direction and no change for a total of 48 subjects in a table called differential_expression.
(1) Retrieve the number of subjects that have an expression change direction of "down" and 48 subjects with no change from a table called differential_expression.
(2) What are the subjects that have an upregulated differential expression and a total of 48 subjects with no change in expression?
(3) Find the number of subjects whose expression did not change and whose expression changed in the downward direction in the table "differential_expression" where there are 48 subjects.
(4) Retrieve the number of subjects that have an expression change direction of "down" and a subject count of 48 from the table differential_expression.
(5) Retrieve the number of subjects that have decreased expression and a total of 48 subjects with no change in expression from the table "differential_expression".
(6) Find the number of subjects whose expression was decreased and did not change in a differential expression study where there were 48 total subjects.
(7) Retrieve the number of subjects whose expression did not change and changed in the downward direction from the differential_expression table.
