Original Query:
SELECT T1.site_prediction FROM disease_mutation_impact_prediction AS T1 WHERE T1.tool = "polyphen" or T1.id = 3906
GPT-3 choices:
(0) What are the site predictions for disease mutation impact from the tool "polyphen" or with ID 3906 in the table disease_mutation_impact_prediction?
(1) Get the site prediction for all rows in the disease_mutation_impact_prediction table where the tool is "polyphen" or the id is 3906.
(2) Retrieve the site prediction for the disease mutation impact from the table "disease_mutation_impact_prediction" where the tool is "polyphen" or the id is equal to 3906.
(3) Retrieve the predicted site from the disease mutation impact prediction database for the tool "polyphen" or for entry with ID 3906.
(4) Find the predicted site of impact for disease mutations using PolyPhen or the entry with an id of 3906 from the disease_mutation_impact_prediction table.
(5) "Get the site prediction from disease_mutation_impact_prediction where the tool is 'polyphen' or the ID is equal to 3906."
(6) Find the site prediction from the disease mutation impact prediction table where the tool is "polyphen" or the ID is equal to 3906.
(7) Retrieve the site prediction data from disease_mutation_impact_prediction where the tool is "polyphen" or the id is 3906.
