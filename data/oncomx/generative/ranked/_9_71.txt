GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the FDA IDs of all biomarkers from the "biomarker_fda_ncit_term" table that are not equal to "FDA000096", joining with the "biomarker_fda" table on matching ID values.
(1) Get all the FDA IDs from the biomarker_fda_ncit_term table where the corresponding biomarker_fda_id is not equal to "FDA000096" and join it with the biomarker_fda table.
(2) Retrieve the FDA NCIt IDs for biomarkers associated with FDA other than "FDA000096".
(3) Get the biomarker FDA ID for the FDA-approved biomarkers that have a corresponding NCIt term, excluding the entry with an ID of "FDA000096".
(4) What is the biomarker FDA NCIt term's ID for all biomarkers in the FDA database except for the one with an ID of "FDA000096"?
(5) Get the FDA IDs of all biomarkers from the Biomarker FDA NCIT Term table that are associated with a biomarker in the Biomarker FDA table, excluding the biomarker with ID "FDA000096".
(6) Find the FDA NCIt term for biomarkers that are not equal to "FDA000096" from the table biomarker_fda_ncit_term, joining with the table biomarker_fda.
(7) Find the biomarker FDA NCIT term IDs for all biomarker FDA IDs that are not equal to "FDA000096".
