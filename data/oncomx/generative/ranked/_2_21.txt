###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.biomarker_fda_id, count(*) FROM biomarker_fda_ncit_term AS T1  GROUP BY T1.biomarker_fda_id
GPT-3 choices:
(0) "Count the number of biomarker FDA NCIT terms for each unique biomarker FDA ID."
(1) What is the count of NCIt terms associated with each FDA biomarker ID in the biomarker_fda_ncit_term table?
(2) Count the number of biomarker NCIT terms for each unique FDA biomarker ID in the biomarker_fda_ncit_term table.
(3) Count the number of instances for each biomarker from the biomarker_fda_ncit_term table and group them by their respective FDA ID.
(4) How many times does each FDA biomarker have associated NCIt terms?
(5) How many biomarker FDA IDs are there and how many times do they appear in the biomarker FDA NCIT term table?
(6) How many biomarker terms are associated with each FDA biomarker ID in the table of biomarker-FDA-NCIT term associations?
(7) How many occurrences of biomarker FDA terms are there for each unique biomarker FDA ID?
