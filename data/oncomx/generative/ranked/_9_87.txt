Original Query:

GPT-3 choices:
(0) Get the disease-mutation IDs from the "disease_mutation_tissue" table where the corresponding UBERON anatomical entity ID is not equal to "UBERON:0002384", and this UBERON anatomical entity ID is joined with the "anatomical_entity" table.
(1) Find the IDs of disease-mutation-tissue associations where the corresponding anatomical entity is not "placenta".
(2) Find the disease mutation ID from the table "disease_mutation_tissue" by joining it with the table "anatomical_entity" on their shared column "uberon_anatomical_id", but exclude any rows where the value in column "id" in table "anatomical_entity" is equal to "UBERON:0002384".
(3) Find the disease mutation IDs from the table that contains the relationship between diseases and mutations, but only for mutations found in anatomical entities other than "UBERON:0002384" (skin tissue).
(4) Retrieve the disease mutation IDs from the table disease_mutation_tissue, where the associated anatomical entity's ID is not "UBERON:0002384".
(5) Retrieve the disease-mutation IDs from the table "disease_mutation_tissue" where the corresponding anatomical entity in the "anatomical_entity" table is not equal to "UBERON:0002384".
(6) Retrieve the disease mutation IDs for all tissues except skin (UBERON:0002384) by joining the disease_mutation_tissue and anatomical_entity tables on their respective IDs, where the anatomical entity is not skin.
(7) Find the IDs of disease mutations associated with tissues that are not UBERON:0002384 according to the anatomical entity table.
