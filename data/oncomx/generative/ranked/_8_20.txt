GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the expression level relative to the gene from healthy individuals for all anatomical locations except for the fallopian tube.
(1) Retrieve the relative expression levels of genes from healthy individuals, excluding those from the anatomical site with the ID "UBERON:0001782".
(2) Retrieve the relative gene expression levels from healthy tissues, excluding those from the anatomical structure with ID "UBERON:0001782".
(3) Retrieve the expression levels of genes from healthy individuals, excluding those from the anatomical region with ID "UBERON:0001782", as stored in the table "healthy_expression", specifically selecting the relative expression level column.
(4) Retrieve the relative gene expression levels from healthy individuals for all anatomical locations except for "UBERON:0001782".
(5) Retrieve the gene relative expression level from healthy individuals for all anatomical locations except "UBERON:0001782".
(6) Retrieve the expression levels relative to each gene from the healthy_expression table, excluding those with an associated UBERON anatomical ID of "UBERON:0001782".
(7) Retrieve the relative expression levels of genes from healthy tissue excluding those from the anatomical location "UBERON:0001782".
