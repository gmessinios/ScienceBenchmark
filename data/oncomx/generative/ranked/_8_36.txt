###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.doid FROM cancer_tissue AS T1 WHERE T1.uberon_anatomical_id != "UBERON:0001043"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the DOID identifiers for cancer tissues that do not have a UBERON anatomical ID of "UBERON:0001043".
(1) Get the disease ontology ID from the cancer_tissue table where the Uberon anatomical ID is not equal to "UBERON:0001043".
(2) Find all diseases from the Cancer Tissue database that have a DOID identifier and do not have an Uberon anatomical ID of "UBERON:0001043".
(3) Retrieve the DOID values from the cancer_tissue table where the associated UBERON anatomical ID is not "UBERON:0001043".
(4) Get the disease ontology identifiers for cancer tissues from a table called "cancer_tissue" where the anatomical ID is not equal to "UBERON:0001043".
(5) Find the DOID values from cancer tissues where the UBERON anatomical ID is not equal to "UBERON:0001043".
(6) Find the disease ontology IDs for cancer tissues where the associated Uberon anatomical ID is not "UBERON:0001043".
(7) What are the Disease Ontology (DOID) IDs of cancer tissues, excluding those with the Uberon anatomical ID "UBERON:0001043"?
