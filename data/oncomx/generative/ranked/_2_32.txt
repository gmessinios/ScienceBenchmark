###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.id, count(*) FROM biomarker_fda AS T1  GROUP BY T1.id
GPT-3 choices:
(0) How many unique biomarker IDs are there in the FDA database and how many entries are associated with each ID?
(1) How many records are there for each unique ID in the biomarker_fda table?
(2) Count the number of entries in the "biomarker_fda" table for each unique ID and display both the ID and its corresponding count.
(3) How many biomarkers have an ID and what is the count of each biomarker?
(4) Count the number of records for each unique biomarker ID in the FDA biomarker database.
(5) What is the number of occurrences for each biomarker ID in the FDA biomarker table?
(6) How many records are there for each biomarker in the FDA database?
(7) How many biomarkers have an ID and what is the total number of those biomarkers?
