###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.doid FROM cancer_tissue AS T1 WHERE T1.uberon_anatomical_id != "UBERON:0000310"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Get the DOIDs for cancer tissues from the cancer_tissue table where the UBERON anatomical ID is not equal to "UBERON:0000310".
(1) What is the disease ontology identifier for cancer tissues that have an Uberon anatomical ID other than "UBERON:0000310"?
(2) Retrieve the Disease Ontology IDs for tissues listed in the Cancer Tissue table, where the anatomical ID is not "UBERON:0000310".
(3) What is the Disease Ontology ID for cancer tissue that does not have a Uberon anatomical ID of "UBERON:0000310"?
(4) Get the disease ontology ID from the cancer_tissue table where the uberon_anatomical_id is not equal to "UBERON:0000310".
(5) Find the cancer tissue's Disease Ontology ID from the Cancer Tissue table where the corresponding Uberon anatomical ID is not "UBERON:0000310".
(6) Get the disease IDs from the cancer_tissue table where the corresponding uberon_anatomical_id is not "UBERON:0000310".
(7) Retrieve the disease ontology IDs from the cancer_tissue table where the corresponding Uberon anatomical ID is not "UBERON:0000310".
