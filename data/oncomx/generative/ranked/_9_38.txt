GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the test manufacturer for all tests in the FDA biomarker database, except for the MammaPrint test.
(1) Find the manufacturers for all biomarker tests listed in the FDA database that have a trade name different from "MammaPrint".
(2) Get the manufacturer for all biomarker tests except "MammaPrint" from the tables "biomarker_fda_test" and "biomarker_fda_test_trial".
(3) Get the test manufacturer for all tests listed in biomarker_fda_test where the trade name does not equal "MammaPrint" by joining with the table biomarker_fda_test_trial.
(4) Find the manufacturer of all FDA-approved tests in the biomarker_fda_test table except for "MammaPrint", which is listed in the biomarker_fda_test_trial table.
(5) Which test manufacturer is associated with the biomarker FDA test where the test trade name is not "MammaPrint"?
(6) Get the manufacturer of all FDA-approved biomarker tests that are not MammaPrint.
(7) What are the manufacturers of biomarker tests that have been tested in clinical trials and whose trade names are not "MammaPrint"?
