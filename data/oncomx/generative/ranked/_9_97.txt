Original Query:

GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the Ensembl transcript ID from the map_protein_disease_mutation table for all entries that have a non-zero doid value in the disease_mutation table.
(1) "Retrieve the ensembl transcript IDs from the map_protein_disease_mutation table that are also found in the disease_mutation table and have a disease ontology ID other than 0."
(2) Find the Ensembl transcript IDs from the map_protein_disease_mutation table that are associated with diseases (doid) in the disease_mutation table.
(3) Retrieve the Ensembl transcript IDs from the map_protein_disease_mutation table for which there exists a corresponding record in the disease_mutation table with a non-zero DOID value.
(4) Find the Ensembl transcript IDs from map_protein_disease_mutation that are also present in disease_mutation and have a DOID other than 0.
(5) "Retrieve the ensembl transcript IDs from the map_protein_disease_mutation table for which there are associated diseases with a DOID value that is not equal to 0 in the disease_mutation table."
(6) Find all Ensembl transcript IDs from the map_protein_disease_mutation table that are associated with disease mutations not equal to 0 in the disease_mutation table.
(7) Retrieve the Ensembl transcript IDs from the map_protein_disease_mutation table for all diseases except those with DOIDs equal to 0.
