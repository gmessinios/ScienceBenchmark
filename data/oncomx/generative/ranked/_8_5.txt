###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.disease_mutation_id FROM disease_mutation_site_annotation AS T1 WHERE T1.description != "Purine nucleoside"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the disease mutation IDs for all mutations that have a description other than "Purine nucleoside" in the disease_mutation_site_annotation table.
(1) Retrieve the disease mutation IDs from the disease_mutation_site_annotation table where the description is not "Purine nucleoside".
(2) Find the disease mutation site ID from the disease mutation site annotation table where the description is not "Purine nucleoside".
(3) Find the disease mutation ID for all entries in the disease_mutation_site_annotation table where the description is not "Purine nucleoside".
(4) Retrieve the disease mutation ID from the site annotation table where the description is not "Purine nucleoside".
(5) Retrieve the disease mutation IDs from the disease_mutation_site_annotation table where the description is not "Purine nucleoside".
