Original Query:
SELECT T1.biomarker_fda_id FROM biomarker_fda_ncit_term AS T1 JOIN biomarker_fda AS T2 ON T1.biomarker_fda_id = T2.id WHERE T2.test_trade_name != "INFORM HER-2/NEU"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Get the FDA biomarker IDs from the table containing NCIt terms for FDA biomarkers, where the test trade name is not "INFORM HER-2/NEU".
(1) Find the biomarker FDA ID for all biomarkers that have a corresponding NCIT term and are not equal to "INFORM HER-2/NEU" in the test trade name.
(2) Get the biomarker FDA ID from the table biomarker_fda_ncit_term for all entries where the associated test trade name in the table biomarker_fda is not "INFORM HER-2/NEU".
(3) Find the ID of biomarkers from the table "biomarker_fda_ncit_term" where the trade name in the table "biomarker_fda" is not equal to "INFORM HER-2/NEU".
(4) Find the FDA biomarker IDs for which the corresponding trade name is not "INFORM HER-2/NEU".
(5) Retrieve the biomarker_fda_id from biomarker_fda_ncit_term where the test_trade_name in the associated record in biomarker_fda is not "INFORM HER-2/NEU".
(6) Retrieve the FDA biomarker IDs for biomarkers that have a trade name other than "INFORM HER-2/NEU".
(7) Find the biomarker FDA IDs from the table biomarker_fda_ncit_term where the test_trade_name in the biomarker_fda table is not "INFORM HER-2/NEU".
