(1) Get the Ensembl transcript IDs from disease mutation data for a disease with DOID identifier 3963 and a mutation frequency of 4.
(2) Find the Ensembl transcript ID from disease_mutation where doid is 3963 and mutation frequency is 4.
(3) What are the Ensembl transcript IDs for mutations associated with DOID 3963 that have a mutation frequency of 4?
(4) Get the Ensembl transcript ID from disease mutations where the Disease Ontology ID is 3963 and the mutation frequency is 4.
(5) Find the Ensembl transcript IDs for disease mutations where the associated disease has a DOID of 3963 and a mutation frequency of 4.
(6) Get the ensembl transcript ID from disease_mutation where the doid is 3963 and mutation frequency is equal to 4.
(7) Retrieve the ensembl transcript ID from disease_mutation where the disease ID is 3963 and the mutation frequency is 4.
