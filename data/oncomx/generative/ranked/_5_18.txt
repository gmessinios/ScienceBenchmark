Original Query:
SELECT T1.mutation_freq FROM disease_mutation AS T1    ORDER BY T1.id DESC LIMIT 1
GPT-3 choices:
(0) What is the frequency of mutations listed in the "disease_mutation" table, ordered from highest to lowest, and limited to only the most recent entry?
(1) What is the mutation frequency of the most recent entry in the disease_mutation table?
(2) "Retrieve the mutation frequency from the most recent entry in the disease_mutation table, ordered by id in descending order, limited to 1."
(3) Get the frequency of mutations in the most recent entry in the "disease_mutation" table, sorted by descending order of ID, and only return the top result.
(4) Retrieve the mutation frequency from the latest entry in the table "disease_mutation", sorted by ID in descending order, limited to only one result.
(5) Get the mutation frequency of the latest entry in the disease_mutation table.
(6) What is the frequency of mutations in the most recent entry in the "disease_mutation" table?
(7) Retrieve the mutation frequency from the most recent record in the table "disease_mutation", ordered by ID in descending order, limited to 1 result.
