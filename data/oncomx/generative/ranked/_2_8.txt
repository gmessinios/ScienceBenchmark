###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.disease_mutation_id, count(*) FROM disease_mutation_site_annotation AS T1  GROUP BY T1.disease_mutation_id
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Count the number of disease mutation sites for each disease mutation ID in the table "disease_mutation_site_annotation".
(1) Find the number of annotations for each disease mutation by grouping them based on their corresponding ID in the table "disease_mutation_site_annotation".
(2) Count the number of times each disease mutation appears in the table "disease_mutation_site_annotation" and group the results by the unique identifier for each disease mutation.
(3) Count the number of occurrences for each disease mutation ID in the table "disease_mutation_site_annotation".
(4) Count the number of occurrences of each unique disease mutation ID in the table "disease_mutation_site_annotation".
(5) How many disease mutation sites are associated with each unique disease mutation ID in the database?
(6) Count the number of disease mutation site annotations for each unique disease mutation ID.
(7) What is the count of mutation sites for each disease mutation in the disease_mutation_site_annotation table?
