Original Query:
SELECT T1.gene_symbol FROM xref_gene_ensembl AS T1 JOIN species AS T2 ON T1.speciesid = T2.speciesid WHERE T2.speciesid = 9606
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the gene symbol from the table xref_gene_ensembl where the speciesid matches 9606, and join it with the species table on matching speciesids.
(1) What are the gene symbols for all genes that have an Ensembl cross-reference and belong to the species with ID 9606?
(2) Retrieve the gene symbol from the xref_gene_ensembl table for all species where the speciesid is equal to 9606 and join it with the species table to ensure that only records for humans are included.
(3) Retrieve the gene symbol from the Ensembl cross-reference table for human species.
(4) Find the gene symbols from the xref_gene_ensembl table for all species where the species ID is equal to 9606, which is the ID for humans.
(5) Retrieve the gene symbol from the xref_gene_ensembl table for all species with a speciesid of 9606, joined with the species table on matching speciesids.
(6) Get the gene symbols from the xref_gene_ensembl table where the speciesid is 9606 and join it with the species table to retrieve only those records that match with the same speciesid in both tables.
(7) Find the gene symbol from the table "xref_gene_ensembl" where the species id is equal to 9606, joining it with the table "species" using their shared column "speciesid".
