###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.test_adoption_evidence FROM biomarker_fda_test AS T1    ORDER BY T1.test_number_genes DESC LIMIT 1
GPT-3 choices:
(0) What is the evidence of adoption for the test with the highest number of genes in biomarker_fda_test?
(1) What is the FDA adoption evidence for the test with the highest number of genes in the biomarker_fda_test table?
(2) Find the test adoption evidence from biomarker_fda_test in descending order based on the number of genes and limit the result to 1.
(3) Get the evidence for test adoption from biomarker_fda_test table, and sort it in descending order by the number of genes, and select only the first record.
(4) Get the evidence for test adoption from the biomarker_fda_test table, ordering by the test number of genes in descending order and selecting only the top result.
(5) "Retrieve the evidence of adoption for the most extensively tested biomarker from the FDA's database of biomarker tests, ordered by number of genes tested in descending order."
(6) Get the adoption evidence for the test with the highest number of genes in descending order from the biomarker_fda_test table.
(7) Retrieve the adoption evidence for the biomarker with the highest number of tested genes from the FDA's biomarker testing data.
