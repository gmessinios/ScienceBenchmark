Original Query:
SELECT T1.speciesid FROM xref_gene_ensembl AS T1 JOIN species AS T2 ON T1.speciesid = T2.speciesid WHERE T2.speciescommonname = "mouse"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the species ID from the table xref_gene_ensembl where the corresponding species common name is "mouse".
(1) Find the species ID of all genes in the "xref_gene_ensembl" table that belong to the species with a common name of "mouse", by joining it with the "species" table and selecting the corresponding species ID.
(2) Get the species ID for the mouse from the xref_gene_ensembl and species tables, where the common name in the species table is "mouse".
(3) Get the species ID for mouse from the xref_gene_ensembl table by joining it with the species table and selecting the species ID where the species common name is "mouse".
(4) What is the species ID for the mouse in the table of cross-referenced genes and Ensembl?
(5) Find the species ID for all records in the xref_gene_ensembl table that correspond to the "mouse" species name.
(6) Retrieve the species ID for all species in the "xref_gene_ensembl" table where the common name is "mouse".
(7) Find the species ID from the xref_gene_ensembl table where the corresponding species common name is "mouse".
