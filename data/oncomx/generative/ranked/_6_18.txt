Original Query:
SELECT T1.histological_type FROM biomarker_fda_test AS T1 WHERE T1.test_study_design = "ProObs" and T1.specimen_type = "Saliva"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) What are the histological types of biomarker tests in FDA that have a study design of "ProObs" and use saliva as the specimen type?
(1) What is the histological type of biomarker FDA test in ProObs study design with specimen type Saliva?
(2) "Retrieve the histological type from biomarker FDA tests where the test study design is ProObs and the specimen type is saliva."
(3) Retrieve the histological type from the biomarker_fda_test table where the test_study_design is "ProObs" and the specimen_type is "Saliva".
(4) Retrieve the histological type from the biomarker_fda_test table where the test study design is ProObs and the specimen type is Saliva.
(5) "Retrieve the histological type from the biomarker FDA test table where the test study design is ProObs and the specimen type is Saliva."
(6) What is the histological type for biomarker FDA test when the study design is ProObs and the specimen type is Saliva?
(7) Retrieve the histological type from biomarker_fda_test where the test study design is ProObs and the specimen type is Saliva.
