SELECT biomarker.id FROM biomarker AS biomarker WHERE biomarker.test_is_a_panel = False

###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.id FROM biomarker AS T1 WHERE T1.test_is_a_panel = False
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the id of biomarker from the table biomarker where test_is_a_panel is false.
(1) "Retrieve the id of biomarkers that are not classified as panels."
(2) Get the ID of all biomarkers that are not a panel test from the "biomarker" table.
(3) Retrieve the id of all biomarkers from the biomarker table where the test is not a panel.
(4) Get the IDs of all biomarkers that are not panels from the table "biomarker".
(5) Get the id of biomarker from the table biomarker where test_is_a_panel is not equal to True.
(6) What is the ID of all biomarkers that are not part of a panel test?
(7) Find the ID of all biomarkers that are not part of a panel test.
