Original Query:
SELECT T1.name FROM stage AS T1 JOIN healthy_expression AS T2 ON T1.id = T2.uberon_developmental_id WHERE T2.expression_score != 27.80000
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the name of stages from the stage table where the expression score in the healthy_expression table is not equal to 27.80000 and is joined with the developmental id in the stage table that matches with the uberon_developmental_id in the healthy_expression table.
(1) Retrieve the names of all stages from the stage table that have a corresponding entry in the healthy_expression table with an expression score different from 27.80000.
(2) Find the names of stages that are associated with healthy expressions and have an expression score different from 27.80000 in the table "healthy_expression" by joining it with the table "stage" on their corresponding IDs.
(3) What are the names of all developmental stages associated with healthy expression scores that are not equal to 27.80000?
(4) Retrieve the names of stages that have a developmental ID in the healthy expression table and do not have an expression score of 27.8.
(5) Find the names of all stages in which there is healthy expression that does not have an expression score of 27.80000.
(6) What are the names of stages where the expression score in the healthy_expression table is not equal to 27.80000, joining on stage.id and healthy_expression.uberon_developmental_id?
(7) Retrieve the name of each stage from the "stage" table where there is a matching developmental ID in the "healthy_expression" table and the expression score is not equal to 27.80000.
