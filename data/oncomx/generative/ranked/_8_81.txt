(2) Retrieve the uberon anatomical ID from the cancer_tissue table for all entries except those with a doid of 363.
(3) "Retrieve the Uberon anatomical ID from the cancer_tissue table for all entries where the DOID is not equal to 363."
(4) Get the uberon anatomical ID from the cancer tissue table for all rows where the disease ontology ID is not equal to 363.
(5) Find the Uberon anatomical ID for cancer tissues that are not associated with DOID 363.
(6) Retrieve the Uberon anatomical ID from the cancer tissue table for all entries where the Disease Ontology (DOID) code is not equal to 363.
(7) Get the anatomical ID from cancer tissues where the disease is not 363.
