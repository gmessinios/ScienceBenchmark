GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the FDA biomarker ID for all entries in the "biomarker_fda_ncit_term" table where the associated test submission is not equal to "P190004", by joining with the "biomarker_fda" table.
(1) Find the FDA biomarker IDs from the table biomarker_fda_ncit_term where the test_submission is not equal to "P190004" and join it with the table biomarker_fda.
(2) What are the IDs of all biomarkers from the FDA that have corresponding NCIT terms, excluding those with a test submission code of "P190004"?
(3) Retrieve the biomarker FDA IDs from the NCIT terms table for all biomarkers in the FDA table where the test submission is not equal to "P190004".
(4) What are the biomarker FDA IDs from the biomarker FDA NCIT term table that correspond to biomarker FDA entries where the test submission is not "P190004"?
(5) Find the ID of the biomarker from the FDA database that has a corresponding NCIT term, but is not included in test submission P190004.
(6) Find the biomarker FDA ID from the biomarker FDA NCIT term table where the test submission in the biomarker FDA table is not equal to "P190004".
(7) Find the biomarker FDA NCIT terms that have a biomarker FDA ID and join them with the biomarker FDA table, excluding any where the test submission is not "P190004".
