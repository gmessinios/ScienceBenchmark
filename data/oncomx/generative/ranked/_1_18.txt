Original Query:
SELECT T1.gene_symbol FROM xref_gene_ensembl AS T1 JOIN healthy_expression AS T2 ON T1.ensembl_gene_id = T2.ensembl_gene_id WHERE T2.expression_level_gene_relative = "ABSENT"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the gene symbols from the xref_gene_ensembl table where the ensembl_gene_id matches that of the healthy_expression table and the expression_level_gene_relative is "ABSENT".
(1) Retrieve the gene symbol from the XREF Gene Ensembl table for all genes that have an expression level of "ABSENT" in the Healthy Expression table.
(2) Retrieve the gene symbol from the Xref Gene Ensembl table for genes with an expression level of "ABSENT" in the Healthy Expression table.
(3) What is the gene symbol for each record in xref_gene_ensembl where the expression level in healthy_expression is marked as "ABSENT"?
(4) Retrieve the gene symbol from the xref_gene_ensembl table where the expression level for that gene in the healthy_expression table is "ABSENT".
(5) What are the gene symbols for genes in the healthy_expression table where the expression level is "ABSENT" and their corresponding Ensembl gene IDs can be found in the xref_gene_ensembl table?
(6) Retrieve the gene symbol from the xref_gene_ensembl table for genes that have an expression level of "ABSENT" in the healthy_expression table.
(7) Retrieve the gene symbols from the xref_gene_ensembl table for all genes that have an "ABSENT" expression level in the healthy_expression table.
