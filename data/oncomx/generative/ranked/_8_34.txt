###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.doid FROM biomarker_fda_test AS T1 WHERE T1.test_adoption_evidence != "clinical use"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Which disease identifiers (DOIDs) are associated with FDA-approved biomarkers that have test adoption evidence other than "clinical use"?
(1) What are the DOIDs for all biomarkers in the biomarker_fda_test table that do not have a test adoption evidence of "clinical use"?
(2) "Retrieve the Disease Ontology IDs from the biomarker_fda_test table where the test adoption evidence is not "clinical use"."
(3) Find the disease ontology IDs for all entries in the biomarker_fda_test table where the test adoption evidence is not "clinical use".
(4) Find the DOIDs from the Biomarker FDA Test table where the test adoption evidence is not equal to "clinical use".
(5) What is the disease identifier for all entries in the biomarker_fda_test table where the test adoption evidence is not "clinical use"?
(6) What is the disease ID for all entries in biomarker_fda_test where test_adoption_evidence is not "clinical use"?
(7) What is the disease ID for all biomarkers that have not been adopted for clinical use in the FDA database?
