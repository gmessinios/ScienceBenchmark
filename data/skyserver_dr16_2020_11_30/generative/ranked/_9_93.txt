Original Query:
SELECT T1.specobjid FROM spplines AS T1 JOIN specobj AS T2 ON T1.specobjid = T2.specobjid WHERE T2.segue2_target1 != -2147483647
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Get the specobjid from the spplines table where the segue2_target1 value in the corresponding row in the specobj table is not equal to -2147483647.
(1) Find the specobjid from the spplines table for all objects in the Spectroscopic_objects table with a segue2_target1 value that is not equal to -2147483647.
(2) Retrieve the specobjid values from the spplines table where the segue2_target1 column value in the Spectroscopic_objects table is not equal to -2147483647, and join them with the specobj table on their matching specobjid values.
(3) Retrieve the specobjid from the Stellar_spectal_line_indices table where the specobjid is also present in the Spectroscopic_objects table and the segue2_target1 column does not have a value of -2147483647.
(4) Find the specobjid for all objects with stellar spectral lines in the spplines table that have a corresponding entry in the Spectroscopic_objects table where segue2_target1 does not equal -2147483647.
(5) Find the specobjid values from the spplines table where the segue2_target1 value in the associated Spectroscopic_objects table is not equal to -2147483647.
(6) Find the specobjid from the spplines table for all Stellar_spectal_line_indices where the segue2_target1 value in the associated row of Spectroscopic_objects is not equal to -2147483647.
(7) Retrieve the specobjid from the spplines table for all spectroscopic objects in the Spectroscopic_objects table that do not have a segue2_target1 value of -2147483647.
