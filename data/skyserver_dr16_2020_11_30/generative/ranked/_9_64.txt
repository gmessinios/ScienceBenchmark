Original Query:
SELECT T1.specobjid FROM spplines AS T1 JOIN specobj AS T2 ON T1.specobjid = T2.specobjid WHERE T2.fiberid != 7
GPT-3 choices:
(0) "Retrieve the specobjid from spplines for all stellar spectral line indices, joining with specobj as spectroscopic objects where the fiberid is not equal to 7."
(1) Retrieve the specobjid from the table spplines where the fiberid in the table specobj is not equal to 7.
(2) Retrieve the specobjid from the Stellar_spectal_line_indices table where the Spectroscopic_objects table's fiberid is not equal to 7.
(3) Find the specobjid from the table spplines for objects in the table specobj where the fiberid is not equal to 7.
(4) Get the specobjid values from the Stellar_spectal_line_indices table for all objects in the Spectroscopic_objects table that have a fiberid not equal to 7.
(5) Retrieve the specobjid from Stellar_spectal_line_indices for all objects in Spectroscopic_objects that do not have a fiberid of 7.
(6) Find the specobjid from the table Stellar_spectal_line_indices where the fiberid is not equal to 7 in the table specobj, and also join it with the table Spectroscopic_objects.
(7) Find the specobjid of all Stellar_spectal_line_indices where Spectroscopic_objects.fiberid is not equal to 7 and join it with the specobj table to retrieve corresponding objects.
