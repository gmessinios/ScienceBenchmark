GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the specobjid from the Stellar_spectal_line_indices table where the ra value in the corresponding row in the Spectroscopic_objects table is not equal to 0.0267587999999819.
(1) Retrieve the specobjid from the table spplines for all stellar spectral line indices, where the ra value in the table specobj is not equal to 0.0267587999999819.
(2) Find the specobjid from the spplines table where Spectroscopic_objects have a different ra value than 0.0267587999999819 and are joined with Stellar_spectal_line_indices on their specobjid.
(3) Find the specobjid of all objects with spplines in the Stellar_spectal_line_indices table, joined with the specobj table on matching specobjid values, where the ra column in Spectroscopic_objects does not equal 0.0267587999999819.
(4) Find the specobjid from the spplines table where the ra value in the specobj table is not equal to 0.0267587999999819 and join it with the Spectroscopic_objects table on matching specobjid values.
(5) Get the specobjid from the Stellar_spectal_line_indices table where the Spectroscopic_objects table's ra column is not equal to 0.0267587999999819 and join on the specobjid column.
(6) Retrieve the specobjid from spplines where the corresponding ra value in specobj is not equal to 0.0267587999999819.
(7) Retrieve the specobjid from Stellar_spectal_line_indices for all Spectroscopic_objects where the ra value is not equal to 0.0267587999999819.
