(1) Find the declination values from the photoobj table for photometric objects where the redshift value is not equal to 11.72341.
(2) What is the declination of all objects in the photoobj table that have a redshift value not equal to 11.72341?
(3) Retrieve the declination values from the "dec" column of the "photoobj" table for all objects that do not have a redshift value of 11.72341.
(4) Retrieve the declination values of objects from the photoobj table where the redshift value is not equal to 11.72341.
(5) Find the declination of photometric objects from the photoobj table where the redshift is not equal to 11.72341.
(6) Retrieve the declination values of all photometric objects from the photoobj table, excluding those with a redshift value of 11.72341.
(7) "Retrieve the declination values from the photometric objects where the redshift is not equal to 11.72341."
