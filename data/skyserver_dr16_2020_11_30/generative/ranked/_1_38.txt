Original Query:
SELECT T1.neighbormode FROM neighbors AS T1 JOIN photoobj AS T2 ON T1.objid = T2.objid WHERE T2.extinction_r = 0.01013326
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the nearest neighbor mode from the "neighbors" table where the corresponding objid in the "photoobj" table has an extinction_r value of 0.01013326.
(1) Find the neighbor mode of all objects from the table "neighbors" that have a corresponding entry in the table "photoobj" with an extinction value of 0.01013326 for the r-band filter.
(2) Retrieve the neighbor mode values for all objects in the neighbors table that have an extinction_r value of 0.01013326 in the photoobj table, joining on their shared objid attribute.
(3) Retrieve the nearest neighbor mode from the neighbors table for objects in the photoobj table where the extinction_r value is equal to 0.01013326.
(4) Find the neighbor mode for the nearest neighbour objects joined with photometric objects where the extinction value in the r band is equal to 0.01013326.
(5) Find the neighbor mode for all objects from the photoobj table that have an extinction_r value of 0.01013326, joining with the neighbors table on matching objid values.
(6) Retrieve the neighbor mode from the nearest neighbor objects table where the extinction value for the corresponding object in the photoobj table is equal to 0.01013326.
(7) Find the nearest neighbour mode for objects in the "neighbors" table that have an "objid" matching that of objects in the "photoobj" table with an extinction_r value of 0.01013326.
