Original Query:
SELECT T1.l FROM photoobj AS T1 JOIN specobj AS T2 ON T1.objid = T2.bestobjid WHERE T2.zerr != 2.856912e-06
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the l column from the Photometric_objects table for objects where the bestobjid column in the Spectroscopic_objects table matches the objid column in Photometric_objects and where the zerr column in Spectroscopic_objects does not equal 2.856912e-06.
(1) Get the magnitude value (l) from the photoobj table for objects that have a corresponding bestobjid in the specobj table where the zerr value is not equal to 2.856912e-06.
(2) Retrieve the l column from the photoobj table where the objid in Photometric_objects is equal to the bestobjid in Spectroscopic_objects and the zerr value in Spectroscopic_objects is not equal to 2.856912e-06.
(3) Retrieve the luminosity values (l) from the photometric objects where the best object ID matches between the photoobj and specobj tables and exclude any rows where the redshift error is equal to 2.856912e-06.
(4) Find the l values from Photometric_objects where the bestobjid from Spectroscopic_objects is equal to objid from photoobj and zerr from Spectroscopic_objects is not equal to 2.856912e-06.
(5) Retrieve the value of the "l" column from the Photometric_objects table, where the objid in the photoobj table is equal to the bestobjid in the specobj table and the zerr column in specobj is not equal to 2.856912e-06.
(6) Find the luminosity values of all photometric objects from the photoobj table where the bestobjid in the specobj table is equal to objid in the photoobj table and where the zerr value in Spectroscopic_objects is not equal to 2.856912e-06.
(7) Find the l values from the Photometric_objects table where the bestobjid column in the specobj table is equal to the objid column in Photometric_objects, and also make sure that the zerr column in Spectroscopic_objects does not have a value of 2.856912e-06.
