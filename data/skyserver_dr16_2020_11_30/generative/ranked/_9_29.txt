Original Query:
SELECT T1.specobjid FROM galspecline AS T1 JOIN specobj AS T2 ON T1.specobjid = T2.specobjid WHERE T2.dec != -16.712474
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the specobjid from galspecline for objects that have a dec value not equal to -16.712474 in the Spectroscopic_objects table.
(1) Find the specobjid from the galspecline table where the declination of Spectroscopic_objects is not equal to -16.712474.
(2) Find the specobjid of all galspecline emission line estimates for spectroscopic objects that have a declination value other than -16.712474.
(3) Select the specobjid from the galspecline table where the dec value in the specobj table is not equal to -16.712474.
(4) Find the specobjid from Emission_line_estimates where the dec value for the corresponding Spectroscopic_objects is not equal to -16.712474.
(5) Retrieve the specobjid values from the Emission_line_estimates table for all objects that have a non-matching declination value of -16.712474 in the Spectroscopic_objects table.
(6) Get the specobjid from the galspecline table for all Spectroscopic objects where their dec value is not equal to -16.712474.
(7) Retrieve the specobjid values from the Emission_line_estimates table for all Spectroscopic_objects where the dec value is not equal to -16.712474.
