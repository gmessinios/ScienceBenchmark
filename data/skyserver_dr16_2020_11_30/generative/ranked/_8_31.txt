Original Query:
SELECT T1.r FROM photoobj AS T1 WHERE T1.cmodelmag_u != 14.44426
GPT-3 choices:
(0) What is the r magnitude of Photometric objects from the photoobj table where the cmodelmag_u is not equal to 14.44426?
(1) Get the values in the "r" column from the "photoobj" table where the value in the "cmodelmag_u" column is not equal to 14.44426.
(2) Retrieve the "r" values from the photoobj table where the cmodelmag_u column is not equal to 14.44426 for objects with photometric data.
(3) Retrieve the r-band magnitude from the photoobj table for all objects where the u-band CModel magnitude is not equal to 14.44426.
(4) Retrieve the value of the "r" column from the table "Photometric_objects" for all rows where the value in the "cmodelmag_u" column is not equal to 14.44426.
(5) What is the value of r for all objects with a cmodelmag_u not equal to 14.44426 in the photoobj table?
(6) Find the value of "r" for objects in the photoobj table where cmodelmag_u is not equal to 14.44426.
(7) Retrieve the r-band magnitudes from the photoobj table for all photometric objects where the cmodelmag_u value is not equal to 14.44426.
