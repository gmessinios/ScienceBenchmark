(1) Retrieve the ancillary target1 information from the specobj table for spectroscopic objects with a zerr value that is not equal to 3.503741e-06.
(2) What is the value of the ancillary_target1 column for objects in the Spectroscopic_objects table where the zerr column does not equal 3.503741e-06?
(3) Get the value for "ancillary_target1" from the table "specobj" for objects in which the value of "zerr" is not equal to 3.503741e-06.
(4) What is the ancillary target for all spectroscopic objects where the redshift error is not equal to 3.503741e-06?
(5) Retrieve the ancillary_target1 column from the specobj table for all objects in Spectroscopic_objects where the zerr value is not equal to 3.503741e-06.
(6) Get the ancillary target 1 of all spectroscopic objects in the specobj table where the zerr is not equal to 3.503741e-06.
(7) "Retrieve the ancillary target 1 value from the specobj table for spectroscopic objects that do not have a redshift error of 3.503741e-06."
