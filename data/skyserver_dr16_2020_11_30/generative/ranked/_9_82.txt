Original Query:
SELECT T1.specobjid FROM galspecline AS T1 JOIN specobj AS T2 ON T1.specobjid = T2.specobjid WHERE T2.scienceprimary != 1
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the spectral object ID for all objects in the galactic spectroscopic line table that are not primary science targets.
(1) Find the specobjid of all emission line estimates that are associated with spectroscopic objects that are not considered primary science targets.
(2) Get the specobjid for all emission line estimates from galspecline where scienceprimary is not equal to 1 in the corresponding row of specobj.
(3) Find the specobjid for objects in galspecline where scienceprimary is not equal to 1 in the table specobj.
(4) Retrieve the specobjid from Emission_line_estimates where the scienceprimary column in Spectroscopic_objects is not equal to 1.
(5) Retrieve the specobjid from the Emission_line_estimates table for all objects in the Spectroscopic_objects table that are not labeled as science primary.
(6) Select the specobjid from the galspecline table where the corresponding Spectroscopic_objects have a value of scienceprimary that is not equal to 1.
(7) Retrieve the specobjid from the Emission_line_estimates table for objects in the Spectroscopic_objects table where scienceprimary is not equal to 1.
