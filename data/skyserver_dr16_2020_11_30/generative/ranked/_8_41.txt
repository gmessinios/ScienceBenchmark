###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.objid FROM neighbors AS T1 WHERE T1.neighbormode != 1
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the objid of all nearest neighbor objects from the neighbors table, excluding those with a neighbormode of 1.
(1) Find the object IDs of nearest neighbor objects from the table "neighbors" where the neighbormode is not equal to 1.
(2) Find the object IDs of nearest neighbor objects from the "neighbors" table where the neighbor mode is not equal to 1.
(3) Find the object IDs of the nearest neighbor objects where the neighbor mode is not equal to 1.
(4) Find the objects with the nearest neighbors that do not have a neighbor mode of 1.
(5) "Find the objects that are nearest neighbors and have a neighbor mode other than 1."
(6) Find the objects that are the nearest neighbors of each other, excluding those with a neighbor mode value of 1.
(7) Find the object IDs of nearest neighbor objects where the neighbor mode is not equal to 1.
