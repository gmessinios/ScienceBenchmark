Original Query:
SELECT T1.specobjid FROM spplines AS T1 JOIN specobj AS T2 ON T1.specobjid = T2.specobjid WHERE T2.segue2primary != 1
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the specobjid from the spplines table where the object is not designated as a primary object in the segue2primary column of the specobj table.
(1) Find the specobjid for stellar spectral line indices where the corresponding spectroscopic objects are not considered as primary in the segue2 survey.
(2) "Retrieve the specobjid from the spplines table where the associated spectroscopic object in the specobj table has a segue2primary value of 0."
(3) Find the specobjid values from the table spplines for all stellar spectral line indices where the corresponding specobjid in the table Spectroscopic_objects is not associated with a segue2primary value of 1.
(4) "Retrieve the specobjid from the spplines table for objects that are not primary targets in the Spectroscopic_objects table."
(5) Retrieve the specobjid values from Stellar_spectal_line_indices table where the corresponding Spectroscopic_objects table has a segue2primary column value not equal to 1.
(6) Retrieve the specobjid from the Stellar_spectal_line_indices table for objects in the Spectroscopic_objects table that do not have a value of 1 in their segue2primary column.
(7) Retrieve the specobjid values from the Stellar_spectal_line_indices table where the corresponding objects in the Spectroscopic_objects table do not have a segue2primary value of 1.
