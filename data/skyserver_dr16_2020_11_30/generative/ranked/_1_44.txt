GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the neighbor mode for the nearest objects in the "neighbors" table that have an object ID matching those in the "photoobj" table and a declination of -17.3987483737476.
(1) Retrieve the nearest neighbour mode from the neighbors table for objects in the photoobj table where the declination is -17.3987483737476.
(2) Find the neighbor mode for the nearest neighbor objects from a table called neighbors, which are joined with a table called photoobj using the common column objid, and select only those with a declination value of -17.3987483737476.
(3) Retrieve the mode of nearest neighbour objects from the neighbors table for all Photometric objects with a declination of -17.3987483737476.
(4) Find the neighbor mode of objects in the "neighbors" table that have an object ID matching those in the "photoobj" table with a declination value of -17.3987483737476.
(5) Find the neighbor mode of objects in the neighbors table for photoobj objects with a declination of -17.3987483737476 from the Photometric_objects table.
(6) Find the nearest neighbour mode for objects in the "neighbors" table with an object ID that matches the "objid" column in the "photoobj" table, where the declination of those objects is -17.3987483737476.
(7) Find the neighbor mode of the nearest neighbor objects from the photoobj table where the declination is -17.3987483737476.
