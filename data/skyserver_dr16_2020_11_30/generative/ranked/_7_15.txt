(1) Find the nearest objects that have a neighbor type or mode of 2, or a type of 0.
(2) Find the type of nearest neighbor objects that have either a neighbor mode of 2 or a type of 0.
(3) "Select the neighbor type of nearest neighbour objects where the neighbormode is equal to 2 or the type is equal to 0."
(4) Find the neighbor type of nearest neighbor objects where the neighbor mode is 2 or the object type is 0.
(5) Find the nearest neighbor objects with a neighbor type in which the neighbormode is either 2 or the type is equal to 0.
(6) Retrieve the type of the nearest neighbor objects from the neighbors table where the neighbor mode is 2 or the type is 0.
(7) Find the type of the nearest neighbor objects where either the neighbor mode is 2 or the type is equal to 0.
