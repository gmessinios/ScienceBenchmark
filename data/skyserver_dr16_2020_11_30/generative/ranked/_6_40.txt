Original Query:
SELECT T1.segue2_target1 FROM specobj AS T1 WHERE T1.veldisperr = 35.67467 and T1.scienceprimary = 1
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the Segue2_target1 value from the Spectroscopic_objects table where the veldisperr column is equal to 35.67467 and the scienceprimary column is equal to 1.
(1) What is the target1 from Spectroscopic_objects where the veldisperr is 35.67467 and scienceprimary is equal to 1?
(2) Retrieve the target 1 name of objects in the spectroscopic catalog with a velocity dispersion error of 35.67467 and marked as science primary.
(3) Retrieve the target1 values from the segue2 dataset for all objects with a velocity dispersion error of 35.67467 and are designated as primary science targets.
(4) Find the segue2_target1 value from the specobj table for objects with a veldisperr of 35.67467 and scienceprimary equal to 1.
(5) Select the segue2_target1 values from the specobj table where veldisperr is equal to 35.67467 and scienceprimary is equal to 1.
(6) Find the segue2_target1 of all objects in the specobj table where veldisperr is equal to 35.67467 and scienceprimary is equal to 1.
(7) Find the target for SEGUE2 primary science objects with a velocity dispersion error of 35.67467.
