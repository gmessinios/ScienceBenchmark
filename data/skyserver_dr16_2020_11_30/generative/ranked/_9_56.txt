GPT-3 choices:
(0) Get the value for veldisperr from the table Spectroscopic_objects for all rows where the specobjid is not equal to 299615571526313984 in both tables.
(1) What is the velocity dispersion error for all objects in the spectroscopic_objects table, excluding the object with specobjid 299615571526313984, that have corresponding entries in the galspecline and specobj tables?
(2) Retrieve the velocity dispersion error for all spectroscopic objects that have an emission line estimate and do not have a specobjid of 299615571526313984.
(3) Find the velocity dispersion error for all spectroscopic objects that have a specobjid that is not equal to 299615571526313984 in the galspecline and specobj tables.
(4) Retrieve the velocity dispersion error for all spectroscopic objects with a non-null specobjid in the Emission_line_estimates table, except for the one with a specobjid of 299615571526313984.
(5) Retrieve the value of veldisperr from Spectroscopic_objects for all rows where the specobjid in galspecline does not equal 299615571526313984.
(6) Find the velocity dispersion error for a spectroscopic object that has a spectral object ID not equal to 299615571526313984 by joining the specobj and galspecline tables, then selecting the veldisperr column from the Spectroscopic_objects table.
(7) Find the velocity dispersion error for all objects in the spectroscopic catalog that have an emission line estimate, except for object number 299615571526313984.
