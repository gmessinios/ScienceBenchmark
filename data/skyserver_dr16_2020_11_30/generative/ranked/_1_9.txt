Original Query:
SELECT T1.value FROM photo_type AS T1 JOIN photoobj AS T2 ON T1.value = T2.type WHERE T2.u = 14.90171
GPT-3 choices:
(0) What is the value of the photometrically observed type for objects in the photoobj table with a u value of 14.90171?
(1) What is the value of photometrically observed objects for which the type matches that of photoobj with a u value of 14.90171?
(2) What is the value of the photometrically observed type for objects with a u-value of 14.90171 in the photoobj table?
(3) Retrieve the value of photometrically observed objects for all photo objects with a u-band magnitude of 14.90171.
(4) What is the value for photometrically observed objects where the u-value for photoobj objects is 14.90171?
(5) Retrieve the values of the "value" column from the "photometrically_observed" table for all entries in the "Photometric_objects" table where the value of "type" is equal to 14.90171 and join these values with the values in the "photo_type" table.
(6) What is the value for photometrically observed type in the photoobj table for objects with a u magnitude of 14.90171?
(7) What are the photometric values for objects with a type of 14.90171 in the photoobj table?
