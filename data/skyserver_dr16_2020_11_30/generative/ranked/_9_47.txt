Original Query:
SELECT T1.loadversion FROM photoobj AS T1 JOIN specobj AS T2 ON T1.objid = T2.bestobjid WHERE T2.ancillary_target1 != 1048576
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the load version from the photoobj table for objects that have an ancillary target1 value not equal to 1048576 in the specobj table.
(1) Find the load version of photometric objects where the bestobjid from the specobj table does not match 1048576 in the ancillary_target1 column.
(2) Find the loadversion for Photometric_objects where the objid matches the bestobjid in Spectroscopic_objects and the ancillary_target1 is not equal to 1048576.
(3) What is the load version of photometric objects for all spectroscopic objects that have an ancillary target1 value not equal to 1048576?
(4) Retrieve the load version from the photometric_objects table for objects where the ancillary_target1 value is not equal to 1048576 in the specobj table, joining on objid in both tables.
(5) "Retrieve the load version of photometric objects where the ancillary target1 value is not equal to 1048576 in the Spectroscopic_objects table."
(6) Find the load version from the photometric objects table for which the ancillary_target1 column in the spectroscopic_objects table is not equal to 1048576.
(7) Get the load version for all objects in the Photometric_objects table that have a matching objid in the Spectroscopic_objects table and where the ancillary_target1 column in the Spectroscopic_objects table is not equal to 1048576.
