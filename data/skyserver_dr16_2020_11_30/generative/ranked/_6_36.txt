SELECT Photometric_objects.l FROM photoobj AS Photometric_objects WHERE Photometric_objects.mode = 1 and Photometric_objects.type = 0

###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.l FROM photoobj AS T1 WHERE T1.mode = 1 and T1.type = 0
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Get the luminosity of objects from the photoobj table that are in mode 1 and have a type of 0.
(1) Retrieve the l column from the photoobj table where the mode is 1 and the type is 0, for objects that have photometric measurements.
(2) Retrieve the luminosity value for all photometric objects where the mode is 1 and the type is 0 from the photoobj table.
(3) Find the value of the "l" column in the table "Photometric_objects" where the mode is equal to 1 and the type is equal to 0.
(4) Find the value for the 'l' column from the table 'photoobj' where the mode is 1 and type is 0, and name this collection of values as Photometric_objects.
(5) Retrieve the length of all photometric objects from the photoobj table where their mode is equal to 1 and their type is equal to 0.
(6) Retrieve the "l" column from the photoobj table for all rows where mode is equal to 1 and type is equal to 0.
(7) Find the value of the "l" column for objects in the photoobj table where the mode is equal to 1 and type is equal to 0.
