Original Query:
SELECT T1.cmodelmag_u FROM photoobj AS T1 JOIN photo_type AS T2 ON T1.type = T2.value WHERE T2.name != "DEFECT"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the cmodel magnitude in the u band for all objects that have been observed photometrically and are not considered as DEFECT in the photoobj and photo_type tables.
(1) Retrieve the cmodelmag_u value from Photometric_objects where the type is not "DEFECT" and it has been observed photometrically.
(2) Get the u-band CModel magnitudes for all objects observed photometrically in the photoobj table, excluding those labeled as "DEFECT" in the photo_type table.
(3) "Retrieve the cmodel magnitude in the u-band for all photometrically observed objects from the photoobj table, excluding any that are classified as DEFECT in the photo_type table."
(4) Retrieve the cmodelmag_u value from the Photometric_objects table for all objects that have a type that is not labeled as "DEFECT" in the photo_type table.
(5) Retrieve the model magnitude in the u band for all photometric objects that have been observed photometrically, excluding those with a type of "DEFECT".
(6) Find the u-band CModel magnitude for all photometric objects that have been observed using a photometric method other than "DEFECT".
(7) Find the u-band CModel magnitude for photometric objects that have been observed as part of a photometric survey, excluding those classified as defects.
