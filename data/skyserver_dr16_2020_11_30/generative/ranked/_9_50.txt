GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the redshift error from the spectroscopic objects for all rows where the object ID in the photometric objects table does not equal 1237645943978655770.
(1) Get the redshift error values for all spectroscopic objects that have a bestobjid in the photoobj table and their corresponding objid is not equal to 1237645943978655770.
(2) What is the error value (zerr) of all spectroscopic objects that do not have an object ID of 1237645943978655770 in the photoobj and specobj tables?
(3) Find the redshift error for all spectroscopic objects where the object ID in the photoobj table is not equal to 1237645943978655770.
(4) Get the redshift error value for spectroscopic objects where the best object ID in the specobj table does not match with the objid in the photoobj table, excluding a specific objid.
(5) Retrieve the redshift error for all objects with a spectroscopic match, excluding the object with an objid of 1237645943978655770.
(6) Retrieve the redshift error value for spectroscopic objects that have a matching bestobjid in the specobj and photoobj tables, excluding the specific objid 1237645943978655770.
(7) Retrieve the spectroscopic redshift error for all objects in the specobj table where the corresponding bestobjid does not match the objid in the photoobj table.
