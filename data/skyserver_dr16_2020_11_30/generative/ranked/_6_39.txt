Original Query:
SELECT T1.dec FROM specobj AS T1 WHERE T1.ancillary_target1 = 128 and T1.mjd = 53783
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the declination for spectroscopic objects where the ancillary target is 128 and the modified Julian date is 53783.
(1) What are the declinations of all spectroscopic objects with an ancillary target of 128 and a modified Julian date of 53783?
(2) Retrieve the declination of spectroscopic objects observed on MJD 53783 that have an ancillary target1 value of 128.
(3) Find the declination of spectroscopic objects with ancillary target1 equal to 128 and MJD equal to 53783 from the specobj table.
(4) What are the declinations of all spectroscopic objects with an ancillary target1 value of 128 and an mjd value of 53783?
(5) Retrieve the declination of spectroscopic objects from the table "specobj" where the ancillary target 1 is equal to 128 and the MJD (modified Julian date) is equal to 53783.
(6) What is the declination of spectroscopic objects with an ancillary target of 128 and a modified Julian date of 53783?
(7) Find the declination of all spectroscopic objects with an ancillary target1 value of 128 and an MJD value of 53783.
