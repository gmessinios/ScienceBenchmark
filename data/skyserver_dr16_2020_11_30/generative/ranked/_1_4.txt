GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the type of objects that are nearest neighbors to a set of photometric objects with an i-value of 12.27935, by joining the "neighbors" and "photoobj" tables based on their objid values.
(1) Retrieve the type of nearest neighbor objects from a table called "neighbors" where the objid values match between the "neighbors" and "photoobj" tables, and also where the i value in the "photoobj" table is equal to 12.27935.
(2) Find the type of nearest neighbour objects from the neighbors table, where the corresponding Photometric object has an i-band magnitude of 12.27935.
(3) Find the type of nearest neighbour objects that have an i-band photometric magnitude of 12.27935 in the neighbors and photoobj tables.
(4) Find the types of objects that are nearest neighbors to those with an i-band magnitude of 12.27935 in the photoobj table.
(5) Retrieve the type of nearest neighbour objects from a table called "neighbors" where the object ID matches that in a table called "photoobj" and the value in the column "i" is equal to 12.27935.
(6) Find the types of objects that are nearest neighbors to objects with an i value of 12.27935 in the photoobj table.
(7) Find the type of objects that are nearest neighbours to a particular object with an i-band magnitude of 12.27935 by joining the "neighbors" and "photoobj" tables and selecting the corresponding type from the resulting table.
