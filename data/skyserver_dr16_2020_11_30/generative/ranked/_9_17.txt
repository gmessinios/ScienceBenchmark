Original Query:
SELECT T1.r FROM photoobj AS T1 JOIN neighbors AS T2 ON T1.objid = T2.objid WHERE T2.mode != 1
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the "r" values from the table of Photometric objects for all objects that have an object ID matching with those in the Nearest neighbor objects table and where the mode is not equal to 1.
(1) What is the r value of objects from the Photometric_objects table that have an objid matching those in the Nearest_neighbour_objects table and where the mode is not equal to 1?
(2) Retrieve the 'r' values from the table of photometric objects for all objects that have a nearest neighbor object, excluding those with a mode of 1.
(3) Retrieve the value of the "r" column from the "photoobj" table for all objects where the mode value in the "neighbors" table, joined on their shared objid values, is not equal to 1.
(4) Get the r value for all objects from the Photometric_objects table where their objid matches with the objid in the Nearest_neighbour_objects table, but only if their mode in Nearest_neighbour_objects is not equal to 1.
(5) Find the r values for all objects in the Photometric_objects table that have a matching objid in the Nearest_neighbour_objects table and where the mode value is not equal to 1.
(6) Retrieve the "r" column for objects in the Photometric_objects table that have an object ID matching with those in the Nearest_neighbour_objects table where the mode is not equal to 1.
(7) Find the "r" values for all objects in the photoobj table that have an objid matching one in the neighbors table, where the mode of the neighbor object is not equal to 1.
