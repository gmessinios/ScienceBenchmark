GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the plate ID of spectroscopic objects where the redshift error is not equal to 3.165267e-06.
(1) Find the plate ID for all spectroscopic objects where the error in redshift is not equal to 3.165267e-06.
(2) Retrieve the plate IDs of all objects from the Spectroscopic Objects table where the zerr value is not equal to 3.165267e-06.
(3) What is the plate ID of all spectroscopic objects where the redshift error is not equal to 3.165267e-06?
(4) Which plateids are associated with spectroscopic objects that have a zerr value different from 3.165267e-06?
(5) Retrieve the plate ID of all spectroscopic objects where the redshift error is not equal to 3.165267e-06.
(6) Find the plate IDs for spectroscopic objects with a non-zero z error.
(7) What are the plate IDs of all spectroscopic objects with a non-zero redshift error?
