GPT-3 choices:
(0) What is the velocity dispersion for a star or object with a fiber ID of 379?
(1) Retrieve the velocity dispersion of all stars or the fiber with an ID of 379 from the Spectroscopic_objects table in the specobj database.
(2) Find the velocity dispersion of all stars with a class of "STAR" or a fiberid of 379 from the specobj table.
(3) Retrieve the velocity dispersion of objects that are either classified as a star or have a fiber ID of 379 from the specobj table.
(4) Retrieve the velocity dispersion of all spectroscopic objects where the class is "STAR" or the fiber ID is 379.
(5) Retrieve the velocity dispersion for all spectroscopic objects where the class is a star or the fiberid is 379.
(6) Retrieve the velocity dispersion value for all stars or objects with a fiber ID of 379 from the specobj table as Spectroscopic_objects.
(7) Find the velocity dispersion for a star or object with a fiber ID of 379 from the specobj table.
