GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the mjd value from the Spectroscopic_objects table for all specobjid values that are not equal to 300745044476848128 in the Emission_line_estimates table.
(1) Find the mjd values from Spectroscopic_objects where the specobjid is not equal to 300745044476848128 and has a matching specobjid in galspecline.
(2) Retrieve the modified Julian date from the spectobj table for all spectroscopic objects that have an associated emission line estimate, excluding a specific specobjid.
(3) Get the MJD values for all spectroscopic objects where the specobjid does not equal 300745044476848128 and is present in both the specobj and galspecline tables.
(4) Retrieve the MJD values from the Spectroscopic_objects table for all specobjids in the Emission_line_estimates table that are not equal to 300745044476848128.
(5) Find the MJD values for all spectroscopic objects where the specobjid is not equal to 300745044476848128 in both the specobj and galspecline tables, using the common column specobjid to join them.
(6) Find the MJD values for all spectroscopic objects that have a specobjid in the Emission_line_estimates table, excluding the value 300745044476848128.
(7) What is the Modified Julian Date (mjd) for all spectroscopic objects in the galspecline table, except for the one with specobjid 300745044476848128?
