###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.objid FROM photoobj AS T1 JOIN photo_type AS T2 ON T1.type = T2.value WHERE T2.name = "KNOWNOBJ"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the object ID of all objects in the "photoobj" table where the type of each object is equal to the value "KNOWNOBJ" in the "photometrically_observed" table.
(1) Find the objid for all objects in the photoobj table that have a type value matching "KNOWNOBJ" from the photo_type table with a name of "photometrically_observed".
(2) Find the object ID from the photoobj table for objects that have been observed photometrically and are labeled as "KNOWNOBJ" in the photo_type table.
(3) Get the object IDs for all objects from the table "Photometric_objects" that have a type value matching the name "KNOWNOBJ" in the table "photo_type".
(4) Retrieve the object ID from the photoobj table for objects that are classified as photometrically observed and have a type value of "KNOWNOBJ".
(5) Get the object ID of all objects from the table "Photometric_objects" that have a type value matching the value associated with the name "KNOWNOBJ" in the table "photo_type".
(6) Retrieve the objid of Photometric_objects from the photoobj table where its type is equal to "KNOWNOBJ" as defined in the photo_type table.
(7) Find the objid of photometric objects from the photoobj table that have a type value corresponding to "KNOWNOBJ" in the photo_type table.
