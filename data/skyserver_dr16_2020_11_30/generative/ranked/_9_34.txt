Original Query:
SELECT T1.value FROM photo_type AS T1 JOIN photoobj AS T2 ON T1.value = T2.type WHERE T2.i != 11.57538
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the value of photometrically observed objects from the table photo_type, joining it with objects from the photoobj table where the i column is not equal to 11.57538.
(1) Retrieve the value from the "photometrically_observed" column of the "photo_type" table, for all objects in the "photoobj" table that have a type other than 11.57538 in their "i" column.
(2) Find the photometric values of objects in the photoobj table, where the type is equal to "photometrically observed" and exclude any objects with an i value of 11.57538.
(3) Retrieve the value from the photometrically observed type column for photo objects where the i column is not equal to 11.57538.
(4) Find the photometrically observed values for objects that have a type other than 11.57538 in the photoobj table, joined with the photo_type table.
(5) Find the value of photometrically observed objects where their type in the photoobj table is not equal to 11.57538.
(6) Retrieve the value from the column "value" in the table "photometrically_observed" for all rows where the type in the table "photoobj" is not equal to 11.57538 and also present in both tables.
(7) Retrieve the value from the photometrically_observed table for all objects in the photoobj table where type is not equal to 11.57538 in the i column.
