Original Query:
SELECT T1.ancillary_target1, count(*) FROM specobj AS T1  GROUP BY T1.ancillary_target1
GPT-3 choices:
(0) "How many spectroscopic objects have each unique value for the 'ancillary_target1' column?"
(1) Count the number of occurrences for each unique value in the "ancillary_target1" column from the "specobj" table and group them by their corresponding values.
(2) Count the number of objects in the table "specobj" and group them by their first ancillary target.
(3) How many spectroscopic objects have the same ancillary target 1 value and what is the total count of these objects in the specobj table?
(4) How many objects are there in the Spectroscopic_objects table for each distinct value of ancillary_target1?
(5) Find the number of times each unique value appears in the "ancillary_target1" column of the "specobj" table and group them by their respective values.
(6) How many spectroscopic objects are there for each unique value in the ancillary_target1 column, grouped by those values?
(7) What is the count of occurrences for each unique value in the ancillary_target1 column of the specobj table, grouped by that same column?
