Original Query:
SELECT T1.specobjid FROM spplines AS T1 JOIN specobj AS T2 ON T1.specobjid = T2.specobjid WHERE T2.fiberid != 587
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the specobjid from the Stellar_spectal_line_indices table for all records where the fiberid in the Spectroscopic_objects table is not equal to 587.
(1) Find the specobjid of Stellar_spectal_line_indices where the fiberid is not 587 by joining it with the specobj table and selecting only the corresponding objects.
(2) "Find the specobjid values from spplines where the fiberid is not equal to 587 in the corresponding entry in specobj."
(3) Retrieve the specobjid from the Stellar_spectal_line_indices table where the fiberid is not equal to 587 in the Spectroscopic_objects table.
(4) Retrieve the specobjid from the Stellar_spectal_line_indices table for all entries where the fiberid in the Spectroscopic_objects table is not equal to 587.
(5) Find the specobjid values from the spplines table where the fiberid is not equal to 587 and join it with the specobj table on matching specobjid values.
(6) Find the specobjid from the spplines table where the fiberid is not equal to 587 in the Spectroscopic_objects table.
(7) Retrieve the specobjid from the spplines table where the corresponding fiberid in the specobj table is not equal to 587.
