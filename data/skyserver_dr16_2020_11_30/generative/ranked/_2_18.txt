SELECT Photometric_objects.cmodelmag_r, count(*) FROM photoobj AS Photometric_objects  GROUP BY Photometric_objects.cmodelmag_r

###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.cmodelmag_r, count(*) FROM photoobj AS T1  GROUP BY T1.cmodelmag_r
GPT-3 choices:
(0) "How many objects are there with a cmodel magnitude in the r-band, and what is the count of each distinct cmodel magnitude?"
(1) "Count the number of objects and their corresponding cmodelmag_r values from the table 'photoobj', grouped by cmodelmag_r, and display the results."
(2) Count the number of objects in the photoobj table, grouped by their cmodelmag_r value and display both the cmodelmag_r value and count.
(3) Count the number of objects in the photometric catalog, grouped by their r-band CModel magnitude.
(4) Count the number of objects in the photoobj table grouped by their cmodelmag_r value, and also include the corresponding cmodelmag_r value for each group.
(5) Find the cmodelmag_r values and the number of objects associated with each value from the photoobj table grouped by cmodelmag_r.
(6) Count the number of objects in the "photoobj" table and group them by their "cmodelmag_r" value, while also selecting the corresponding values for "cmodelmag_r".
(7) How many objects have a CModel magnitude in the r band, and what is the total number of objects for each unique value of CModel magnitude in the r band?
