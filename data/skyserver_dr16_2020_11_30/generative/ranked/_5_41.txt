Original Query:
SELECT T1.zerr FROM specobj AS T1    ORDER BY T1.segue2_target1 DESC LIMIT 1
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Get the redshift error from the specobj table, sorted by segue2_target1 in descending order, with a limit of 1.
(1) Retrieve the redshift error for the object with the highest target priority in the specobj table, ordered by descending segue2_target1.
(2) What is the redshift error of the object with the highest segue2_target1 value in the specobj table?
(3) "Retrieve the redshift error value from the spectroscopic objects table, ordered by descending segue2 target 1 values, with a limit of 1 result."
(4) "Retrieve the redshift error values for all spectroscopic objects, ordering by the SEGUE-2 target 1 flag in descending order and limit to only the first result."
(5) Get the redshift error from the first row of the specobj table, sorted in descending order by the segue2_target1 column.
(6) "Retrieve the spectroscopic redshift uncertainty from the first row of the table specobj, sorted in descending order by segue2_target1 and limited to 1 result."
(7) Find the redshift error of the object with the largest value for the 'segue2_target1' column in the table 'specobj'.
