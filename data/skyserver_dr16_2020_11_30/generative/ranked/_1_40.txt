Original Query:
SELECT T1.loadversion FROM photoobj AS T1 JOIN photo_type AS T2 ON T1.type = T2.value WHERE T2.name = "UNKNOWN"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the loadversion value from Photometric_objects for all photoobj where type equals to "UNKNOWN" and photometrically_observed.name is equal to "UNKNOWN".
(1) "Select the load version from the photo objects table where the type is unknown and is observed photometrically."
(2) Retrieve the load version from the photometric_objects table for all objects that have a type of "UNKNOWN" according to the photo_type table.
(3) Retrieve the load version for all photometric objects that have an unknown type.
(4) Find the loadversion for all objects in the photoobj table that have a type of "UNKNOWN" according to the photometrically_observed table.
(5) Retrieve the load version of photometric objects from the photoobj table where the type matches with "UNKNOWN" in the photo_type table and is classified as photometrically observed.
(6) What is the load version for all photometric objects that have an unknown photo type?
(7) Retrieve the load version of photometric objects from the photoobj table, where the type value matches "UNKNOWN" in the photo_type table and is equivalent to being classified as photometrically observed.
