Original Query:
SELECT T1.specobjid FROM galspecline AS T1 JOIN specobj AS T2 ON T1.specobjid = T2.specobjid WHERE T2.programname != "seglowlatf"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the specobjid from the Emission_line_estimates table for all records where the programname in the Spectroscopic_objects table is not equal to "seglowlatf".
(1) Get the specobjid from the table Emission_line_estimates where the programname in the table Spectroscopic_objects is not equal to "seglowlatf".
(2) Find the specobjid values from the Emission_line_estimates table where the associated Spectroscopic_objects have a program name other than "seglowlatf".
(3) Find the specobjid from the galspecline table where the programname in the corresponding row of the specobj table is not "seglowlatf".
(4) What is the specobjid of all objects in the galspecline table that are also present in the specobj table, but have a program name different from "seglowlatf"?
(5) "Retrieve the specobjid values from Emission_line_estimates where the programname in Spectroscopic_objects is not equal to 'seglowlatf'."
(6) Find the specobjid of all Emission_line_estimates where the programname in the corresponding Spectroscopic_objects is not equal to "seglowlatf".
(7) Find the specobjid of emission line estimates for spectroscopic objects that are not part of the "seglowlatf" program.
