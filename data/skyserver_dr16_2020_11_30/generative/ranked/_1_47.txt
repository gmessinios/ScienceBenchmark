###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.mode FROM neighbors AS T1 JOIN photoobj AS T2 ON T1.objid = T2.objid WHERE T2.field = 180
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the mode values from the nearest neighbor objects in the "neighbors" table for all objects with a field value of 180 in the "photoobj" table.
(1) Retrieve the mode of nearest neighbour objects from the table "neighbors" for all objects in the "photoobj" table with a field value of 180.
(2) Find the mode of the nearest neighbor objects from the photo objects where the field value is equal to 180.
(3) Find the mode of the nearest neighbor objects for photo objects with an objid that matches in both the neighbors and photoobj tables, specifically for those with a field value of 180.
(4) Find the mode of the nearest neighbour objects' modes for all photometric objects in field 180.
(5) Retrieve the mode value of the nearest neighbor objects from the neighbors table, matching them with objects from the photoobj table where the field column equals 180.
(6) Find the mode of the nearest neighbor objects for all objects in the photoobj table that have a field value of 180.
(7) Find the mode of the nearest neighbor objects from the table "neighbors" for photo objects in field 180 in the table "photoobj".
