GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the count of observations grouped by their photometrically observed value.
(1) Find the number of values in the "photometrically_observed" column of the "photo_type" table and group them by their respective values.
(2) How many times was each value in the "value" column of the table "photometrically_observed" observed and what is the corresponding count for each value?
(3) How many times has each value in the "photometrically_observed" column been observed in the "photo_type" table?
(4) Count the number of photometrically observed values and group them by their value.
(5) What is the count of photometrically observed values in the photo_type table?
(6) What is the total number of observations for each photometric value in the "photometrically_observed" table?
(7) How many records are there in the photo_type table grouped by the value of photometrically_observed, showing both the value and its count?
