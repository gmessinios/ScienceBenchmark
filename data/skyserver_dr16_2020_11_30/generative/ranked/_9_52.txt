GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the bestobjid from Spectroscopic_objects for all specobjids in Stellar_spectal_line_indices where the specobjid is not equal to 303022962758412288.
(1) What is the bestobjid of a spectroscopic object that has a corresponding entry in spplines and does not have a specobjid value of 303022962758412288?
(2) Find the best object ID from the spectroscopic objects table where the specobjid is not equal to 303022962758412288 in the stellar spectral line indices table.
(3) Find the best object identification number from the spectroscopic objects table where the specobjid is not equal to 303022962758412288 in the spplines table.
(4) Find the best object ID from the Spectroscopic objects table where the specobjid does not equal 303022962758412288 and join it with the spplines table on matching specobjids.
(5) Retrieve the bestobjid from the Spectroscopic_objects table where the specobjid is not equal to 303022962758412288 and is joined with the Stellar_spectal_line_indices table on their shared specobjid column.
(6) Find the bestobjid from Spectroscopic_objects where the specobjid does not equal 303022962758412288 and join it with Stellar_spectal_line_indices.
(7) Find the best object ID for a spectroscopic object that is not equal to 303022962758412288 and has a matching specobjid in both the specobj and spplines tables.
