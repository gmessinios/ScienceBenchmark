Original Query:
SELECT T1.loadversion FROM specobj AS T1 WHERE T1.veldisperr != 9.597716
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the load version for objects from the "specobj" table where the velocity dispersion error is not equal to 9.597716.
(1) Find the version numbers of all loaded objects from the specobj table, specifically those that have a veldisperr value that is not equal to 9.597716.
(2) Retrieve the load version from the Spectroscopic_objects table for all objects that have a velocity dispersion error that is not equal to 9.597716.
(3) What is the load version for all spectroscopic objects where the velocity dispersion error is not equal to 9.597716?
(4) Retrieve the load version from the Spectroscopic_objects table for all rows where the veldisperr value is not equal to 9.597716.
(5) Retrieve the loadversion from the Spectroscopic_objects table for objects in the specobj table that have a veldisperr value not equal to 9.597716.
(6) Find the load version for spectroscopic objects where the velocity dispersion error is not equal to 9.597716.
(7) Find the version of the Spectroscopic_objects that have a veldisperr value different than 9.597716.
