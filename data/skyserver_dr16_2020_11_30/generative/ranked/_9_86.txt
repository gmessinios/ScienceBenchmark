Original Query:
SELECT T1.distance FROM neighbors AS T1 JOIN photoobj AS T2 ON T1.objid = T2.objid WHERE T2.cmodelmag_u != 14.57352
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the distance of the nearest neighbour objects from the table "neighbors" where their object ID matches with the object ID in the table "photoobj" and their cmodelmag_u value is not equal to 14.57352.
(1) Find the distance of the nearest neighbour objects, joined with the photoobj table on matching objids, where the cmodelmag_u value is not equal to 14.57352 for each object in the photoobj table.
(2) Find the distance from the nearest neighbor object for all objects in the photoobj table whose cmodelmag_u value is not equal to 14.57352 and join it with the neighbors table using objid as the common identifier.
(3) "Retrieve the distance values from the nearest neighbour objects table for all objects in the photometric objects table that have a cmodelmag_u value not equal to 14.57352."
(4) What is the distance for the nearest neighbor object in the neighbors table for each object in the photoobj table where the cmodelmag_u value is not equal to 14.57352 in the Photometric_objects?
(5) Retrieve the distance of the nearest neighbor objects from a table called "neighbors" and match it with the corresponding object in a table called "photoobj", where the object's cmodelmag_u value is not equal to 14.57352.
(6) Find the distance of the nearest neighbour objects where the cmodelmag_u value is not equal to 14.57352 from the Photometric objects.
(7) Find the distance values from the nearest neighbour objects where the corresponding Photometric objects do not have a cmodelmag_u value of 14.57352.
