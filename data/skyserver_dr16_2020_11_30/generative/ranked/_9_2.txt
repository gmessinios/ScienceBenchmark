Original Query:
SELECT T1.programname FROM specobj AS T1 JOIN photoobj AS T2 ON T1.bestobjid = T2.objid WHERE T2.cmodelmag_u != 14.00395
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the program name for all spectroscopic objects whose corresponding photometric objects do not have a cmodel magnitude of 14.00395 in the u-band.
(1) What is the program name for spectroscopic objects where the best photometric object id does not have a cmodel magnitude of 14.00395 in the u-band?
(2) What are the program names for spectroscopic objects that have a best object ID matching with a photometric object's object ID and have a cmodel magnitude in the u-band not equal to 14.00395?
(3) Find the program names for spectroscopic objects where their best object IDs match with photometric objects and the cmodel magnitude in the u band is not equal to 14.00395.
(4) Get the program names for all spectroscopic objects whose corresponding photometric object does not have a u-band cmodel magnitude of 14.00395.
(5) Find the program name of all spectroscopic objects whose best photometric object has a cmodelmag_u value that is not equal to 14.00395.
(6) Find the program names of all spectroscopic objects whose bestobjid matches that of photometric objects where the cmodelmag_u value is not equal to 14.00395.
(7) Get the program name for all spectroscopic objects where the corresponding photometric object does not have a cmodelmag_u value of 14.00395.
