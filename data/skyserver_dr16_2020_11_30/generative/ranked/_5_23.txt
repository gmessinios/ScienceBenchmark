Original Query:
SELECT T1.distance FROM neighbors AS T1    ORDER BY T1.neighbortype DESC LIMIT 1
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the distance value from the nearest neighbour objects table, sorted by neighbortype in descending order and limit the result to only the first row.
(1) Retrieve the distance of the nearest neighbor object, sorted by neighbor type in descending order, with a limit of one result.
(2) Retrieve the distance value from the "neighbors" table for the nearest neighbor object, ordered by neighbor type in descending order and limiting the results to one.
(3) Find the distance of the nearest neighbor object from the table "neighbors", ordered by neighbor type in descending order, with a limit of one result.
(4) Find the distance of the nearest neighbor object and order it by the type of neighbor, then limit the result to only one record.
(5) Retrieve the distance of the nearest neighbor object from the "neighbors" table, ordered by neighbor type in descending order, and only retrieve one result.
(6) Retrieve the distance of the nearest neighbor object, sorting by neighbortype in descending order and limiting the result to only one row.
(7) Get the distance of the nearest neighbor object, in descending order based on neighbor type, and limit it to 1 result.
