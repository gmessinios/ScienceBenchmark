SELECT Nearest_neighbour_objects.mode, count(*) FROM neighbors AS Nearest_neighbour_objects  GROUP BY Nearest_neighbour_objects.mode

###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.mode, count(*) FROM neighbors AS T1  GROUP BY T1.mode
GPT-3 choices:
(0) "Count the number of nearest neighbor objects grouped by their mode."
(1) "How many objects are there for each mode, when grouped by the mode, from the table of nearest neighbor objects?"
(2) "Count the number of objects in the 'neighbors' table and group them by their mode."
(3) Find the mode and count the number of occurrences for each mode in the table named "neighbors".
(4) Count the number of times each mode appears in the "neighbors" table and group the results by mode.
(5) What is the number of occurrences for each mode value in the "neighbors" table?
(6) Find the number of objects and their corresponding modes in the table "neighbors" grouped by mode.
(7) Find the mode of the nearest neighbour objects and count how many instances there are for each mode.
