SELECT Nearest_neighbour_objects.neighborobjid FROM neighbors AS Nearest_neighbour_objects WHERE Nearest_neighbour_objects.type != 0

###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.neighborobjid FROM neighbors AS T1 WHERE T1.type != 0
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the IDs of the nearest neighboring objects that are not of type 0.
(1) Find the object IDs of the nearest neighbors that have a type that is not equal to 0 in the table "neighbors".
(2) Find the neighbor object IDs for the nearest neighbors that have a type other than 0 in the table called "neighbors."
(3) Retrieve the neighborobjid from the Nearest_neighbour_objects table for all objects in the neighbors table where the type is not equal to 0.
(4) Find the objects that are nearest neighbors and have a type that is not equal to 0.
(5) Find the object IDs of the nearest neighbors that are not of type 0 in the table "neighbors."
(6) Find the IDs of the nearest neighbor objects that have a type other than 0 in the neighbors table.
(7) Find the IDs of all neighbor objects that are not of type 0 in the "neighbors" table.
