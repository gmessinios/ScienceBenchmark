###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.mjd FROM specobj AS T1 WHERE T1.survey != "boss"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Get the MJD values from the Spectroscopic_objects table where the survey is not "boss".
(1) Find the MJD values from specobj where the survey is not "boss".
(2) Find the Modified Julian Date from the table of spectroscopic objects where the survey is not "boss".
(3) Retrieve the MJD values for all spectroscopic objects in the database that are not associated with the BOSS survey.
(4) Find the Modified Julian Date for all spectroscopic objects from the specobj table where the survey is not equal to "boss".
(5) Find the MJD values for all spectroscopic objects that are not from the "boss" survey.
(6) What is the modified Julian date for all spectroscopic objects that were not part of the BOSS survey?
(7) What is the modified Julian date for all spectroscopic objects from the specobj table where the survey does not equal "boss"?
