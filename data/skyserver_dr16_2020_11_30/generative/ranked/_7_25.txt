Original Query:
SELECT T1.special_target1 FROM specobj AS T1 WHERE T1.zerr = 3.583556e-06 or T1.subclass = "M0III (168720)"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the special target1 for all objects in the specobj table where zerr is equal to 3.583556e-06 or subclass is equal to "M0III (168720)".
(1) Retrieve the special target1 value from the Spectroscopic_objects table for objects where the zerr value is equal to 3.583556e-06 or the subclass is "M0III (168720)".
(2) What is the special target 1 for objects with a redshift error of 3.583556e-06 or a subclass of "M0III (168720)" in the Spectroscopic_objects table in specobj?
(3) What is the special target 1 for a spectroscopic object with a redshift error of 3.583556e-06 or subclass of "M0III (168720)"?
(4) Retrieve the special target 1 of all spectroscopic objects where the redshift error is equal to 3.583556e-06 or the subclass is "M0III (168720)".
(5) Retrieve the special target 1 for objects with a redshift error of 3.583556e-06 or subclass "M0III (168720)".
(6) What is the special target 1 for objects in the Spectroscopic_objects table with a redshift error of 3.583556e-06 or a subclass of "M0III (168720)"?
(7) Retrieve the special target 1 column value from the specobj table for objects where either the redshift error is equal to 3.583556e-06 or the subclass is "M0III (168720)".
