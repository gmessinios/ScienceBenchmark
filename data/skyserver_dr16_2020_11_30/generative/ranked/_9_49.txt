Original Query:
SELECT T1.specobjid FROM spplines AS T1 JOIN specobj AS T2 ON T1.specobjid = T2.specobjid WHERE T2.subclass != "G0Va (143761)"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the specobjid of stellar spectral line indices for all spectroscopic objects that do not have a subclass of "G0Va (143761)".
(1) Find the specobjid for all Stellar_spectal_line_indices where the corresponding Spectroscopic_objects have a subclass that is not "G0Va (143761)".
(2) Retrieve the specobjid from Stellar_spectal_line_indices for Spectroscopic_objects where the subclass is not "G0Va (143761)".
(3) Retrieve the specobjid from the spplines table where the corresponding spectroscopic object's subclass is not equal to "G0Va (143761)".
(4) Retrieve the specobjid values from the spplines table where the associated Spectroscopic_objects have a subclass that is not equal to "G0Va (143761)".
(5) Find the specobjid from spplines where the subclass of Spectroscopic_objects is not "G0Va (143761)".
(6) Retrieve the specobjid from the spplines table where the subclass of Spectroscopic_objects is not "G0Va (143761)" and match it with the corresponding specobjid in the specobj table.
(7) Find the specobjid values from Stellar_spectal_line_indices table that are not associated with Spectroscopic_objects having a subclass of "G0Va (143761)".
