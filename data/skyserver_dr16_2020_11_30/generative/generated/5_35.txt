Original Query:
SELECT T1.z FROM specobj AS T1    ORDER BY T1.special_target1 DESC LIMIT 1
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Select the redshift value from the table of spectroscopic objects, ordering them by the special target 1 column in descending order and limiting the result to only one row.
(1) What is the redshift of the spectroscopic object with the highest value for special target 1?
(2) Find the redshift value for the spectroscopic object with the highest special target number, in descending order.
(3) Find the redshift value for the object with the highest special target priority from the specobj table, in descending order.
(4) Get the value for "z" from the table "specobj" and sort it in descending order by the column "special_target1", then return only the first row.
(5) Get the redshift (z) value from the specobj table for the spectroscopic object with the highest special_target1 value, sorted in descending order and limited to one result.
(6) "Get the redshift value from the specobj table for the object with the highest special target 1, ordered in descending order and limiting to one result."
(7) Get the redshift value for the spectroscopic object with the highest special target priority.
