###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.neighbormode FROM neighbors AS T1 WHERE T1.type != 6
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the neighbor mode of nearest neighbor objects where the type is not equal to 6.
(1) Find the neighbor mode for objects in the neighbors table that have a type different than 6.
(2) Retrieve the neighbor mode of nearest neighbor objects where the type is not equal to 6.
(3) Retrieve the neighbor mode of all nearest neighbor objects from the neighbors table, excluding any objects with a type of 6.
(4) Find the neighbor mode for all nearest neighbor objects that are not of type 6.
(5) Find the neighbor mode of objects in the "neighbors" table where the type is not equal to 6.
(6) Retrieve the neighbormode of all nearest neighbour objects from the neighbors table where the type is not equal to 6.
(7) Find the mode of all neighbors in the 'neighbors' table that have a type value other than 6.
