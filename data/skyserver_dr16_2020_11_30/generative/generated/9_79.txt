Original Query:
SELECT T1.clean FROM photoobj AS T1 JOIN neighbors AS T2 ON T1.objid = T2.objid WHERE T2.objid != 1237678617968771303
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Get the clean photometric objects from the photoobj table that have a different objid than 1237678617968771303, which can be found in the neighbors table as Nearest_neighbour_objects.
(1) "Retrieve the clean value from the Photometric_objects table for all objects in the Nearest_neighbour_objects table, excluding the object with objid 1237678617968771303."
(2) Find the clean values from the photometric_objects table for objects that have a nearest neighbor object with a different objid than 1237678617968771303 in the neighbors table.
(3) Get the clean photometric objects for all photoobj entries that have an object ID that does not match 1237678617968771303 in the neighbors table.
(4) Retrieve the "clean" column from the "photoobj" table for objects in which their "objid" does not equal 1237678617968771303 and are also present in the "neighbors" table.
(5) Find the clean photometric objects from the photoobj table that have a matching objid in the neighbors table, but do not have an objid equal to 1237678617968771303.
(6) Retrieve the "clean" data from the Photometric_objects table for objects where the objid in the Nearest_neighbour_objects table is not equal to 1237678617968771303.
(7) Find the clean photometric object for all objects in the photoobj table that have a different objid than 1237678617968771303, where the objid is also present in the neighbors table.
