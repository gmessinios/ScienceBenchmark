###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.neighborobjid FROM neighbors AS T1 WHERE T1.neighbormode = 1
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the IDs of the nearest neighbour objects from the neighbors table where the neighbor mode is equal to 1.
(1) Find the object IDs of the nearest neighbor objects from a table called "neighbors" where the neighbormode column equals 1.
(2) Find the neighbor object ID from the nearest neighbour objects where the neighbor mode is equal to 1.
(3) What is the neighbor object ID for the nearest neighbor objects where the neighboring mode is equal to 1?
(4) "Find the object ID of the nearest neighbor in the neighbors table where the neighbor mode is equal to 1."
(5) Find the IDs of objects that are nearest neighbors and have a neighbor mode value of 1 in the neighbors table.
(6) Find the IDs of the objects that are closest neighbors according to their neighbor mode being set to 1.
(7) Find the object IDs of the nearest neighbor objects from the "neighbors" table where the "neighbormode" column has a value of 1.
