Original Query:
SELECT T1.cmodelmag_u FROM photoobj AS T1    ORDER BY T1.clean DESC LIMIT 1
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the cmodel magnitude value for the u-band from the photoobj table for objects in descending order of cleanliness, with a limit of one result.
(1) Find the u-band CModel magnitude for the brightest photometric object in the photoobj table, ordered by descending clean value.
(2) Find the cmodelmag_u value from the photoobj table for Photometric objects, order them by their clean status in descending order, and only show the top result.
(3) What is the u-band cmodel magnitude for the brightest clean object in the photometric catalog?
(4) "Select the cmodelmag_u value from the photoobj table for objects in the Photometric_objects table, ordered by their cleanliness in descending order, with a limit of one result."
(5) Retrieve the u-band cmodel magnitude from the Photometric_objects table in the photoobj database, and sort the results by descending clean flag value, limiting to only the first result.
(6) Retrieve the u-band cmodel magnitude from the photoobj table for Photometric_objects, sorted in descending order by their cleanliness and limit the results to only one.
(7) Get the cmodelmag_u value from the Photometric_objects table in the photoobj database, sort it by the clean column in descending order, and return only one result.
