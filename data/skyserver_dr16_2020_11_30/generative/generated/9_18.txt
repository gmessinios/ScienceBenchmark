Original Query:
SELECT T1.neighborobjid FROM neighbors AS T1 JOIN photo_type AS T2 ON T1.neighbortype = T2.value WHERE T2.description != "Trail: A satellite or asteroid or meteor trail. (not yet used)"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the IDs of objects that are the nearest neighbors to a given object, but only if they have been observed photometrically and their type is not a satellite, asteroid, meteor trail.
(1) Retrieve the neighborobjid from the Nearest_neighbour_objects table for all objects that have been photometrically observed and are not classified as trails.
(2) "Retrieve the object IDs of nearest neighbour objects where their type is classified as photometrically observed, but not described as a satellite, asteroid, or meteor trail."
(3) Retrieve the object IDs of the nearest neighbors from a table called "neighbors" based on their type, which is obtained from another table called "photo_type", excluding any objects with a description of "Trail: A satellite or asteroid or meteor trail".
(4) "Find the IDs of nearby objects that have been photometrically observed, excluding those that are trails."
(5) Find the neighbor object IDs from the table of nearest neighbors that have been photometrically observed and do not have a description of "Trail: A satellite or asteroid or meteor trail."
(6) What are the IDs of objects that are the nearest neighbors to a given object, and have been observed through photometric analysis (not including trails)?
(7) Retrieve the neighbor object IDs from the table of neighbors, where the corresponding neighbor type is equal to a value from the photo_type table that has a description not equal to "Trail: A satellite or asteroid or meteor trail (not yet used)".
