Original Query:
SELECT T1.ra FROM specobj AS T1 WHERE T1.veldisperr != 7.423635
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Get the right ascension of objects from the table "specobj" where the velocity dispersion error is not equal to 7.423635.
(1) Retrieve the right ascension values for objects in the "specobj" table that have a veldisperr value not equal to 7.423635, and name this table "Spectroscopic_objects".
(2) What are the right ascensions of all objects in the specobj table that have a veldisperr value not equal to 7.423635?
(3) Get the right ascension values from the "specobj" table for objects with a non-null value in the "veldisperr" column that is not equal to 7.423635.
(4) What is the right ascension of all spectroscopic objects from the specobj table that have a veldisperr value other than 7.423635?
(5) Find the right ascension of all objects from the table "specobj" where the velocity dispersion error is not equal to 7.423635.
(6) Retrieve the right ascension values from the "specobj" table for all objects in the "Spectroscopic_objects" view that do not have a velocity dispersion error of 7.423635.
(7) Find the right ascension value from the specobj table for objects in Spectroscopic_objects that have a veldisperr value different than 7.423635.
