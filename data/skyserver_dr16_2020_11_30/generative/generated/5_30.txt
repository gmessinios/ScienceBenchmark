Original Query:
SELECT T1.neighbormode FROM neighbors AS T1    ORDER BY T1.objid DESC LIMIT 1
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Get the neighbor mode from the neighbors table for the object with the highest objid.
(1) "Retrieve the nearest neighbour mode from the list of neighbors, ordered by object ID in descending order, with a limit of one."
(2) Find the nearest neighbor mode of the object with the highest ID in the neighbors table.
(3) Get the mode of the neighbor column from the neighbors table, ordering by descending objid and only selecting the last row.
(4) "Select the neighbor mode for the nearest neighbor object in the neighbors table, ordering by descending object ID and only retrieving the top result."
(5) Get the nearest neighbour mode from the "neighbors" table, ordering by object ID in descending order and limiting the result to 1 row.
(6) "Find the nearest neighbour mode for the most recent object in the neighbors table."
(7) Retrieve the nearest neighbour mode for the object with the largest ID from the neighbors table.
