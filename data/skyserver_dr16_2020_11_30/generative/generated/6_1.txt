Original Query:
SELECT T1.zwarning FROM specobj AS T1 WHERE T1.segue2primary = 0 and T1.veldisp = 186.0735
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the zwarning values from the specobj table for all spectroscopic objects that are not associated with a primary segue2 object and have a veldisp value of 186.0735.
(1) Retrieve the zwarning value for objects in the specobj table where segue2primary is not equal to 0 and veldisp is equal to 186.0735.
(2) Get the "zwarning" value from the "specobj" table for all objects in which the values of both "segue2primary" and "veldisp" are equal to 0 and 186.0735, respectively, in the table with an alias of "Spectroscopic_objects".
(3) Select the zwarning values from the specobj table for all spectroscopic objects that are not primary targets in SEGUE-2 and have a veldisp value of 186.0735.
(4) Find the zwarning value for objects with segue2primary = 0 and veldisp = 186.0735 in the specobj table of the database.
(5) Retrieve the zwarning value from the specobj table for objects in the Spectroscopic_objects column where segue2primary is not equal to 0 and veldisp is equal to 186.0735.
(6) Retrieve the zwarning value from the specobj table for all objects in the Spectroscopic_objects table that have segue2primary equal to 0 and veldisp equal to 186.0735.
(7) Retrieve the zwarning value for all objects in the specobj table where segue2primary is equal to 0 and veldisp is equal to 186.0735.
