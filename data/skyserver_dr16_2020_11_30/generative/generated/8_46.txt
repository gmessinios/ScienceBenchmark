GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the zwarning values from the specobj table for all Spectroscopic_objects with a plate value that is not equal to 999.
(1) Retrieve the zwarning values for all objects in the specobj table where the plate number is not equal to 999.
(2) Find the zwarning values for all objects in the specobj table where the plate is not equal to 999.
(3) Find the zwarning value for all objects in the specobj table where the plate number is not equal to 999.
(4) Retrieve the zwarning values for all spectroscopic objects from the specobj table except for those with a plate value of 999.
(5) Retrieve the zwarning value from Spectroscopic_objects for all objects where the plate number is not equal to 999.
(6) Retrieve the redshift warning information for all spectroscopic objects with a plate number other than 999.
(7) Retrieve the zwarning values from the specobj table for all objects with a plate value not equal to 999.
