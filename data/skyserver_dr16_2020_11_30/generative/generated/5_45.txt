Original Query:
SELECT T1.dec FROM photoobj AS T1    ORDER BY T1.z DESC LIMIT 1
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Get the declination value of the photometric object with the highest redshift from the photoobj table, in descending order.
(1) Retrieve the declination of the object with the highest redshift from the photoobj table, ordered by redshift in descending order, limited to one result.
(2) Find the declination of the photometric object with the highest redshift from the photoobj table, in descending order, limited to only one result.
(3) "Get the declination values of the photometric objects from the photoobj table, ordered by their redshift in descending order, and limit the results to one object."
(4) Retrieve the declination value from the photoobj table for photometric objects, ordered by redshift in descending order, limited to one result.
(5) Find the declination of the photometric object with the highest redshift from the photoobj table, sorted in descending order by redshift, and limit to only one result.
(6) Find the declination value for the object with the highest redshift from the photoobj table, ordered in descending order by redshift and limiting the results to one.
(7) Get the declination of the object with the highest redshift from the photoobj table, sorted in descending order by redshift, and limit the results to one.
