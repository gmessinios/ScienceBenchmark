Original Query:
SELECT T1.mode FROM neighbors AS T1 JOIN photoobj AS T2 ON T1.objid = T2.objid WHERE T2.b != -73.5024977792631
GPT-3 choices:
(0) What is the mode of the nearest neighbor objects for photo objects with a b value of -73.5024977792631?
(1) Find the mode of the nearest neighbor objects from the neighbors table, where their object IDs match with those in the photoobj table and have a b value that is not equal to -73.5024977792631.
(2) Retrieve the mode of nearest neighbor objects from the "neighbors" table where the objid matches with the "objid" column in the "photoobj" table and the value of column b in "photoobj" is not equal to -73.5024977792631.
(3) Find the mode of the nearest neighbour objects from the neighbors table for all photoobj objects in the photoobj table where their b value is not equal to -73.5024977792631.
(4) Retrieve the mode from the nearest neighbor objects for all photo objects with a b value that is not equal to -73.5024977792631.
(5) Find the mode of the nearest neighbor objects' mode column for all objects where the b value in the Photometric_objects table is not equal to -73.5024977792631.
(6) Retrieve the mode values from the "mode" column of all nearest neighbor objects whose "objid" matches that of any object in the "photoobj" table with a "b" value that is not equal to -73.5024977792631.
(7) Find the mode of nearest neighbor objects where the photometric object's b value is not equal to -73.5024977792631.
