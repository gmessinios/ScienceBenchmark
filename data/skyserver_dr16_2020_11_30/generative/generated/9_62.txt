GPT-3 choices:
(0) What is the load version for the spectroscopic objects where the specobjid does not equal 310762150211643392 in the specobj table and is also present in the spplines table with a matching specobjid?
(1) Get the load version for the spectroscopic object with a specobjid of 310762150211643392 from the Stellar_spectral_line_indices table joined with the Spectroscopic_objects table.
(2) Find the loadversion for the Spectroscopic_objects where the specobjid is not equal to 310762150211643392 and it is joined with spplines using Stellar_spectal_line_indices.
(3) What is the version number of the loaded data from the spectroscopic_objects table for a given specobjid if it is not equal to 310762150211643392 and is joined with the spplines table on the same specobjid?
(4) Find the load version of the spectroscopic object where the specobjid does not equal 310762150211643392, by joining the tables specobj and spplines and selecting from Spectroscopic_objects.
(5) Find the load version of the spectroscopic objects for which the specobjid is not equal to 310762150211643392 and are also present in the spplines table.
(6) Retrieve the load version from the Spectroscopic_objects table for all rows where the specobjid does not equal 310762150211643392 and has a matching specobjid in the spplines table.
(7) Retrieve the loadversion from Spectroscopic_objects where the specobjid is not equal to 310762150211643392 in Stellar_spectal_line_indices.
