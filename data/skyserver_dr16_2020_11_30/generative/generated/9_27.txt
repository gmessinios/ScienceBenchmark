Original Query:
SELECT T1.zwarning FROM specobj AS T1 JOIN photoobj AS T2 ON T1.bestobjid = T2.objid WHERE T2.extinction_r != 0.009874543
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the zwarning value for all Spectroscopic objects where the extinction_r value is not equal to 0.009874543 in their corresponding Photometric objects.
(1) Retrieve the zwarning value from the specobj table for all objects where the extinction_r value in the photoobj table is not equal to 0.009874543 and their bestobjid values match.
(2) Retrieve the zwarning value from Spectroscopic_objects where the bestobjid of Spectroscopic_objects matches the objid of Photometric_objects and the extinction_r value in Photometric_objects is not equal to 0.009874543.
(3) Retrieve the zwarning values from the specobj table for all objects where the extinction_r value in the photoobj table is not equal to 0.009874543, and join these tables on bestobjid and objid, respectively.
(4) Retrieve the zwarning values for all spectroscopic objects where the corresponding photometric object's extinction_r value is not equal to 0.009874543.
(5) Retrieve the zwarning value for all objects where the bestobjid of a spectroscopic object matches the objid of a photometric object, and the extinction_r value for that photometric object is not equal to 0.009874543.
(6) Retrieve the redshift warning for all spectroscopic objects whose best object identification number matches with an object in the photometric table where the extinction value for the r-band is not equal to 0.009874543.
(7) Retrieve the zwarning value for all objects in the Spectroscopic_objects table that have a corresponding bestobjid value in the Photometric_objects table, where the extinction_r value in the Photometric_objects table is not equal to 0.009874543.
