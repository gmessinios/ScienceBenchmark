Original Query:
SELECT T1.class FROM specobj AS T1 WHERE T1.loadversion = 1017 or T1.ancillary_target1 = 2048
GPT-3 choices:
(0) "Retrieve the class of objects from the specobj table where the loadversion is equal to 1017 or the ancillary_target1 value is equal to 2048."
(1) Find the class of spectroscopic objects from a table called specobj, specifically selecting objects with either a load version of 1017 or an ancillary target1 value of 2048.
(2) Find the class of spectroscopic objects from the specobj table where the loadversion is equal to 1017 or the ancillary_target1 column contains 2048.
(3) Select the class of spectroscopic objects from the specobj table where the loadversion is equal to 1017 or ancillary_target1 is equal to 2048.
(4) Select the class of objects from the table of spectroscopic objects where either the load version is 1017 or the first ancillary target equals 2048.
(5) Retrieve the class of spectroscopic objects from a table called specobj where the loadversion is 1017 or the ancillary_target1 is equal to 2048.
(6) Retrieve the class of objects from the "specobj" table if their loadversion is equal to 1017 or their ancillary_target1 is equal to 2048, in the "Spectroscopic_objects" dataset.
(7) Retrieve the class of objects from the specobj table that have a loadversion of 1017 or an ancillary target1 value of 2048.
