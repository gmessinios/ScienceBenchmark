Original Query:
SELECT T1.mjd, count(*) FROM specobj AS T1  GROUP BY T1.mjd
GPT-3 choices:
(0) "Retrieve the count of spectroscopic objects for each distinct modified Julian date (mjd) from the specobj table."
(1) Find the count of rows grouped by mjd in the specobj table and label it as Spectroscopic_objects.
(2) Count the number of objects for each MJD value in the Spectroscopic_objects table.
(3) How many objects were observed on each MJD (modified Julian date) and how many of those objects were observed in total, from the table named "specobj" with the alias "Spectroscopic_objects"?
(4) Count the number of rows in the specobj table grouped by mjd and display the mjd value and count for each group.
(5) "What is the total count of spectroscopic objects for each MJD (Modified Julian Date) value in the specobj table?"
(6) What is the number of spectroscopic objects and their corresponding Modified Julian Date (mjd) values in the specobj table grouped by mjd?
(7) What is the count of all records grouped by the mjd value in the specobj table?
