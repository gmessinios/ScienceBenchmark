Original Query:
SELECT T1.mode FROM neighbors AS T1 JOIN photo_type AS T2 ON T1.neighbortype = T2.value WHERE T2.name != "GHOST"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) "Find the mode of nearest neighbour objects where the photometrically observed value is not equal to 'GHOST'."
(1) "Retrieve the mode of the nearest neighbor objects where the neighbor type is photometrically observed, excluding any objects labeled as 'GHOST'."
(2) "Retrieve the mode of the nearest neighbour objects that have been photometrically observed, excluding those labeled as 'GHOST'."
(3) Find the mode of nearest neighbor objects where the photometrically observed name is not "GHOST".
(4) What is the mode of the nearest neighbor objects where the photo type is not equal to "GHOST"?
(5) Retrieve the mode of nearest neighbour objects from the neighbors table, where the neighbor type is not equal to "GHOST" and has been observed photometrically according to the photo_type table.
(6) Find the mode of the nearest neighbour objects whose type is photometrically observed and exclude those that have a name of "GHOST".
(7) Find the mode of nearest neighbor objects that have been observed photometrically and are not classified as "GHOST".
