Original Query:
SELECT T1.fiberid FROM specobj AS T1 WHERE T1.segue2primary = 0 or T1.ancillary_target1 = 1179648
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the fiber ID of objects in the specobj table where the segue2primary column is equal to 0 or the ancillary_target1 column is equal to 1179648.
(1) What is the fiber ID of objects from the "specobj" table where either the "segue2primary" value is 0 or the "ancillary_target1" value is 1179648?
(2) "Get the fiber IDs from specobj for objects where their segue2primary value is equal to 0 or their ancillary_target1 value is equal to 1179648."
(3) Find the fiber IDs of objects from the "specobj" table where the segue2primary column is equal to 0 or the ancillary_target1 column is equal to 1179648, and label this group as "Spectroscopic_objects".
(4) Retrieve the fiber ID from the specobj table for objects that are not considered a primary target in SEGUE2 or have an ancillary target1 value of 1179648.
(5) Return the fiber ID of all objects in the specobj table where either segue2primary is equal to 0 or ancillary_target1 is equal to 1179648.
(6) Retrieve the fiber ID from the specobj table for objects that are not part of a SEGUE2 primary target or have an ancillary target 1 value of 1179648.
(7) What are the fiber IDs of all spectroscopic objects that are not designated as a primary object in the SEGUE-2 survey and do not have an ancillary target of 1179648?
