###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.cmodelmag_u FROM photoobj AS T1    ORDER BY T1.ra DESC LIMIT 1
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the cmodelmag_u value for Photometric objects from the photoobj table, sorting them by descending ra and limiting the result to 1.
(1) Retrieve the u-band cmodel magnitude for the photometric objects from the photoobj table, ordered by right ascension in descending order, limited to 1 result.
(2) Retrieve the u-band cmodel magnitude of the photometric object with the highest right ascension value from the photoobj table, in descending order.
(3) Find the Cmodel magnitude in the u-band from Photometric objects in the photoobj table, ordered by right ascension in descending order and limit to one result.
(4) Retrieve the u-band cmodel magnitude from the photometric objects table sorted by right ascension in descending order and limit the results to 1.
(5) What is the cmodel magnitude in the u band for the photometric object with the highest right ascension value?
(6) Get the model magnitude in the u-band for objects from the Photometric_objects table, ordered by right ascension in descending order and only selecting one result.
(7) "Retrieve the cmodelmag_u value from the Photometric_objects table in the photoobj database, ordered by descending right ascension and limited to one result."
