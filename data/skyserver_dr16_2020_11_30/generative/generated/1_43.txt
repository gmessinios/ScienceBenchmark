Original Query:
SELECT T1.clean FROM photoobj AS T1 JOIN specobj AS T2 ON T1.objid = T2.bestobjid WHERE T2.segue2primary = 1
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the "clean" attribute from the photoobj table for objects where the objid from the photoobj table matches with bestobjid from specobj table and Spectroscopic_objects' segue2primary attribute is equal to 1.
(1) Retrieve the "clean" value from the "photoobj" table for objects in the "Photometric_objects" and "Spectroscopic_objects" tables where the object IDs match and the "segue2primary" value in the "Spectroscopic_objects" table is equal to 1.
(2) Find the clean photometric objects for all primary Spectroscopic_objects in the segue2primary table, joining on objid and bestobjid from photoobj and specobj tables respectively.
(3) Retrieve the "clean" column from the "photoobj" table for objects where their corresponding objid in the "specobj" table is equal to the bestobjid and also have a value of 1 in the segue2primary column.
(4) Retrieve the clean photometric data for all objects in the photoobj table that have a corresponding entry in the specobj table where the segue2primary column is equal to 1.
(5) Retrieve the clean photometric objects from the photoobj table where the objid matches the bestobjid from the specobj table and where segue2primary equals 1.
(6) Retrieve the "clean" attribute of objects from the "photometric_objects" table, joining it with the "specobj" table on their object ID and filtering for only those where the corresponding entry in the "segue2primary" column is equal to 1.
(7) Retrieve the clean data for Photometric objects from the photoobj table, where the objid of each object matches the bestobjid in the specobj table and Spectroscopic_objects has a value of 1 for segue2primary.
