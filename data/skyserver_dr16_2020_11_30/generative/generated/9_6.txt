Original Query:
SELECT T1.mode FROM neighbors AS T1 JOIN photo_type AS T2 ON T1.neighbortype = T2.value WHERE T2.name != "COSMIC_RAY"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Get the mode of the nearest neighbor objects that have a photo type value that is not equal to "COSMIC_RAY".
(1) Find the mode of the nearest neighbour objects where the photometrically observed name is not "COSMIC_RAY".
(2) Find the mode of nearest neighbour objects where the photo type is not "COSMIC_RAY".
(3) Retrieve the mode of the nearest neighbor objects where the neighbor type is not equal to "COSMIC_RAY" and has been photometrically observed.
(4) Find the mode of nearest neighbor objects where the photo type is not "COSMIC_RAY".
(5) Find the mode of the nearest neighbour objects where the type of the neighbour is not "COSMIC_RAY" and it has been photometrically observed.
(6) Retrieve the mode of the nearest neighbour objects for all observations that are photometrically observed and not classified as "COSMIC_RAY".
(7) Find the mode of the nearest neighbour objects for which the photometric observation type is not "COSMIC_RAY".
