Original Query:
SELECT T1.description FROM photo_type AS T1 JOIN neighbors AS T2 ON T1.value = T2.neighbortype WHERE T2.neighbortype != 0
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the description of the photo type for objects that have a nearest neighbor type other than zero from the photometrically_observed table.
(1) Retrieve the description from the photometrically observed photo type for all objects that are not of type 0 according to their nearest neighbor.
(2) "Retrieve the description of all photometrically observed objects that are neighbors to any object with a non-zero neighbor type."
(3) Find the description of photometrically observed objects that are not listed as type 0 in the table of nearest neighbor objects.
(4) Retrieve the description of photometrically observed objects that are not the nearest neighbors to any other type of object.
(5) Find the description of objects that have been photometrically observed, for all objects that are not type 0 according to the neighbor type in the neighbors table.
(6) Retrieve the descriptions of all photometrically observed objects from a list of nearest neighbor objects, where the neighbor type is not equal to zero.
(7) Get the description of all photometrically observed objects that are not type 0 and have a neighbor.
