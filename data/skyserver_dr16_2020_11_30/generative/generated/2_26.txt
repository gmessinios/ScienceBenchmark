Original Query:
SELECT T1.extinction_r, count(*) FROM photoobj AS T1  GROUP BY T1.extinction_r
GPT-3 choices:
(0) What is the count of objects in the photometric catalog grouped by their r-band extinction values?
(1) How many photometric objects are there for each value of r extinction, and what is the total count of each?
(2) How many Photometric objects have an extinction value for the red filter, and how many objects are there in each group?
(3) "Count the number of objects in the photoobj table grouped by their extinction_r value and also include the corresponding value for each group."
(4) How many objects are in each extinction category based on their extinction in the r-band, listed with the total count of objects?
(5) Find the number of objects and their corresponding extinction values in the "photoobj" table, grouped by the extinction_r column, from the "Photometric_objects" table.
(6) What is the count of objects in the Photometric_objects table grouped by their extinction_r values?
(7) How many objects are there for each value of the extinction_r column in the Photometric_objects table and what is their corresponding count, when selecting from the photoobj table?
