###


Original Query:
SELECT count(*) FROM neighbors AS T1 WHERE T1.mode = 1
GPT-3 choices:
(0) How many objects are there in the neighbors table that have a mode value of 1?
(1) How many objects are there in the "neighbors" table that have a mode value of 1 in the "Nearest_neighbour_objects" column?
(2) How many objects are there in the "neighbors" table that have a mode of 1 in the "Nearest_neighbour_objects" column?
(3) "How many objects have a mode value of 1 in the neighbors table?"
(4) "How many nearest neighbor objects have a mode value of 1 in the 'neighbors' table?"
(5) How many objects are there in the "neighbors" table where the mode is equal to 1 and they are considered nearest neighbors?
(6) Find the count of all objects in the neighbors table where the mode is equal to 1.
(7) Count the number of objects in the "neighbors" table where the mode is equal to 1.
