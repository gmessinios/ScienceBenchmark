Original Query:
SELECT T1.distance FROM neighbors AS T1 JOIN photoobj AS T2 ON T1.objid = T2.objid WHERE T2.g != 12.61056
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the distance of the nearest neighboring objects from the photo objects where the g value is not equal to 12.61056 in the neighbors and photoobj tables.
(1) Find the distance of the nearest objects from the neighbors table where the g value of those objects in the photoobj table is not equal to 12.61056.
(2) What is the distance from the nearest neighbour object for each photoobject where the g value is not equal to 12.61056?
(3) Find the distance of the nearest neighbors from the photo objects where the g value is not equal to 12.61056.
(4) What is the distance of the nearest neighbour objects for all Photometric objects with a g value different from 12.61056?
(5) What is the distance of the nearest neighbour objects from the photoobj objects where the g value is not equal to 12.61056?
(6) Find the distance of the nearest neighbor objects from a list of photo objects where the g value is not equal to 12.61056.
(7) Find the distance of the nearest neighboring objects from the photo objects with a g value not equal to 12.61056, where the data is retrieved from the neighbors and photoobj tables by matching their objid columns.
