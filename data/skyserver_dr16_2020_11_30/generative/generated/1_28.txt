Original Query:
SELECT T1.neighborobjid FROM neighbors AS T1 JOIN photoobj AS T2 ON T1.objid = T2.objid WHERE T2.clean = 0
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the objid of the nearest neighbor objects that are clean based on the photoobj table.
(1) Find the objid of nearest neighbor objects for which the corresponding photoobj has a clean value of 0 in the neighbors and photoobj tables.
(2) Find the IDs of objects that are the nearest neighbors to a given set of photo objects that are not considered clean.
(3) Find the neighbor object IDs of all objects in the neighbors table where the corresponding object ID in the photoobj table has a value of 0 for the clean column.
(4) Find the object IDs of the nearest neighbors for objects in the photoobj table that have a clean value of 0 in the photometric_objects table.
(5) Find the IDs of objects that are nearest neighbors to a given object, but only include those whose corresponding Photometric object has not been flagged as clean.
(6) Find the neighborobjid values from the Nearest_neighbour_objects table for all objects in the Photometric_objects table with a clean value of 0.
(7) Find the nearest neighbor objects with their object IDs from the neighbors table where the photometric objects are not clean, by joining the neighbors and photoobj tables.
