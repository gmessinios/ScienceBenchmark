Original Query:
SELECT T1.specobjid FROM galspecline AS T1 JOIN specobj AS T2 ON T1.specobjid = T2.specobjid WHERE T2.segue2primary != 1
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the specobjid values from the Emission_line_estimates table where the segue2primary column in the specobj table is not equal to 1.
(1) Retrieve the specobjid values from the Emission_line_estimates table for all spectroscopic objects in the Spectroscopic_objects table that are not classified as SEGUE2 primary.
(2) Find the spectroscopic object identification numbers for emission line estimates from the galspecline table that are not primary objects in the specobj table in SEGUE2.
(3) Find the specobjid of all galspecline objects where segue2primary is not equal to 1 in the table specobj.
(4) Find the specobjid for Emission_line_estimates where the segue2primary value in Spectroscopic_objects is not equal to 1.
(5) Retrieve the specobjid values from the Emission_line_estimates table for objects that are in the Spectroscopic_objects table but are not designated as primary objects in Segue 2.
(6) Find the specobjid of all objects with emission line estimates where the object is not a primary target in the segue2 survey.
(7) Find the specobjid for all spectroscopic objects where their segue2primary value is not equal to 1, from the table galspecline.
