GPT-3 choices:
(0) Get the best object identification number from the table of spectroscopic objects where the object's identification number matches that in the emission line estimates.
(1) Retrieve the bestobjid from the Spectroscopic_objects table for the specobj with ID number 300638391848953856 that is also present in the galspecline table under Emission_line_estimates.
(2) "Retrieve the bestobjid from Spectroscopic_objects for a specobj that has a specobjid of 300638391848953856 and is present in the galspecline table as an emission line estimate."
(3) What is the bestobjid value from the specobj table for the row with specobjid equal to 300638391848953856 in the galspecline table?
(4) Find the best object ID for a spectroscopic object where its specobjid is equal to 300638391848953856 in the tables specobj and galspecline.
(5) Retrieve the bestobjid from the Spectroscopic_objects table for the specobj with a matching specobjid in both the Spectroscopic_objects and Emission_line_estimates tables.
(6) Find the best object ID for a spectroscopic object with a specobjid of 300638391848953856 by joining the specobj and galspecline tables and selecting it from Emission_line_estimates.
(7) Find the best object ID for a spectroscopic object where the corresponding emission line estimate's specobjid is 300638391848953856.
