Original Query:
SELECT T1.neighborobjid FROM neighbors AS T1 JOIN photo_type AS T2 ON T1.neighbortype = T2.value WHERE T2.name != "GHOST"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the IDs of nearest neighbor objects that have been observed photometrically and are not classified as "GHOST".
(1) Find the IDs of objects that are nearest neighbours and have a photometric observation type other than "GHOST".
(2) Find the neighbor object IDs of nearest neighbors that have been photometrically observed and are not classified as "GHOST" in the photo_type table.
(3) "Retrieve the IDs of the nearest neighboring objects from a table of neighbors, excluding those that have been photometrically observed as not being GHOSTs."
(4) Find the neighbor object IDs for nearest neighbor objects where the type is photometrically observed and not equal to "GHOST".
(5) Find the ID of the nearest neighbor objects that have been observed photometrically, excluding any objects that have been labeled as "GHOST".
(6) Get the neighborobjid from Nearest_neighbour_objects where the neighbortype is not "GHOST" and is observed photometrically according to the photo_type table.
(7) Find the nearest neighbor objects from the neighbors table, excluding any that are classified as "GHOST" in the photo_type table.
