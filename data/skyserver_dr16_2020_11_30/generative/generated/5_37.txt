Original Query:
SELECT T1.plateid FROM specobj AS T1    ORDER BY T1.z DESC LIMIT 1
GPT-3 choices:
(0) What is the highest plate ID for a spectroscopic object in descending order by redshift?
(1) Give me the plateid of the object with the highest value for z from the table specobj, sorted in descending order and limited to one result.
(2) What is the plateid for the spectroscopic object with the highest redshift?
(3) What is the highest plate ID for a spectroscopic object when sorted by redshift, with a limit of 1?
(4) Find the plate ID of the spectroscopic object with the highest redshift value.
(5) What is the plate ID of the spectroscopic object with the highest redshift?
(6) Select the plate ID of the spectroscopic object from the specobj table, ordering by redshift in descending order and limiting to 1 result.
(7) Find the plate ID of the spectroscopic object with the highest redshift, sorted in descending order, limited to 1 result.
