GPT-3 choices:
(0) "Find the number of occurrences for each neighboring object and group them by their respective neighbor object IDs."
(1) Find the number of occurrences for each neighbor object, grouping them by their corresponding ID.
(2) Count the number of occurrences for each object in the Nearest_neighbour_objects table and group them by their neighborobjid.
(3) Find the number of objects that are nearest neighbors for each unique neighbor object ID in the "neighbors" table.
(4) Find the number of objects that are the nearest neighbors of each object and group them by the ID of the nearest neighbor object.
(5) "How many times does each neighbor object appear in the neighbors table?"
(6) Find the number of objects that are the nearest neighbors of each neighbor object, and group the results by neighbor object ID.
(7) Count the number of occurrences of each neighbor object ID in the "neighbors" table, grouping them by their respective IDs.
