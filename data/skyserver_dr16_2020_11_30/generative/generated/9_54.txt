Original Query:
SELECT T1.u FROM photoobj AS T1 JOIN photo_type AS T2 ON T1.type = T2.value WHERE T2.description != "Galaxy: An extended object composed of many stars and other matter."
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the u values for all photometric objects where the type is not equal to "Galaxy: An extended object composed of many stars and other matter".
(1) Find the u values of all photometric objects that have been classified as not being a galaxy.
(2) Retrieve the value of the "u" column from the table "photoobj" for all objects that have a type description that is not "Galaxy: An extended object composed of many stars and other matter." as described in the table "photo_type".
(3) Retrieve the u band magnitude for all photometric objects that have been observed through photometry and are not galaxies.
(4) Get the u values from the Photometric_objects table for objects that are photometrically observed but not described as galaxies.
(5) Find the u values from the photoobj table for all photometric objects that have been observed as something other than a galaxy.
(6) Retrieve the u-magnitude values from the Photometric_objects table for all objects that have been observed photometrically and are not described as a galaxy.
(7) Find the u values from the photoobj table for objects that have been photometrically observed, excluding galaxies.
