Original Query:
SELECT T1.name FROM photo_type AS T1 JOIN photoobj AS T2 ON T1.value = T2.type WHERE T2.type != 6
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the names of all photometric objects that have been observed, excluding those with a type equal to 6, from the table "photometrically_observed".
(1) Retrieve the names of all objects that have been observed photometrically, excluding those with a type value of 6.
(2) "Get the names of objects that have been observed photometrically but are not type 6 in the photoobj table."
(3) List the names of all objects that have been photometrically observed and are not classified as type 6 in the photoobj table.
(4) Find the names of all objects that have been observed photometrically and are not type 6 in the photo_type table, by joining with the photoobj table on matching type values.
(5) Find the names of all objects that have been observed photometrically and are not of type 6 in the photoobj table.
(6) Find the names of all photometrically observed objects that have a photo type value different from 6 in the photoobj table.
(7) Find the names of all objects in the photoobj table that have a type other than 6, and match those types to their corresponding name in the photo_type table.
