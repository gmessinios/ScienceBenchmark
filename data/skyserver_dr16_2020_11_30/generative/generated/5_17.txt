Original Query:
SELECT T1.veldisp FROM specobj AS T1    ORDER BY T1.zwarning DESC LIMIT 1
GPT-3 choices:
(0) "Retrieve the velocity dispersion of the highest redshift spectroscopic object in ascending order by its warning status from the specobj table."
(1) Find the velocity dispersion of the most recent object in the spectroscopic database, ordering by its redshift warning and limiting to one result.
(2) What is the value for veldisp from the Spectroscopic_objects table, ordered by zwarning in descending order, with a limit of 1 result?
(3) What is the velocity dispersion of the highest redshift spectroscopic object with a warning, in ascending order?
(4) "Retrieve the velocity dispersion for the highest redshift object from the specobj table, sorted in descending order by zwarning, with a limit of one result."
(5) "Get the velocity dispersion from the specobj table for the spectroscopic objects, ordering by zwarning in descending order and limiting to 1 result."
(6) Retrieve the velocity dispersion of the most recent spectroscopic object from the specobj table, ordered by the zwarning column in descending order, with a limit of 1.
(7) Find the velocity dispersion from the table of spectroscopic objects sorted by zwarning in descending order with a limit of one.
