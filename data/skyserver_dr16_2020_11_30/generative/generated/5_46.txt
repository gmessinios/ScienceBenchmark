Original Query:
SELECT T1.mjd FROM photoobj AS T1    ORDER BY T1.cmodelmag_u DESC LIMIT 1
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the MJD value from the Photometric_objects table where the cmodelmag_u column is arranged in descending order and return only the first result.
(1) "Find the Modified Julian Date from the photometric objects table in the photoobj database, sorted by the cmodelmag_u column in descending order and return only the top result."
(2) "Retrieve the modified Julian date from the photoobj table for photometric objects, sorted by the cmodelmag_u column in descending order and return only the top result."
(3) Find the Modified Julian Date for the object with the highest cmodel magnitude in the u band from the table photoobj, sorted in descending order.
(4) Retrieve the modified Julian date from the photoobj table where the cmodelmag_u column is sorted in descending order, limited to only one result.
(5) Find the date (mjd) for the object with the highest cmodelmag_u value in the photoobj table, sorted in descending order.
(6) Find the mjd value for the photometric object with the highest cmodelmag_u value from the photoobj table, sorted in descending order.
(7) What is the latest Modified Julian Date of the most luminous object according to its cmodel magnitude in the u band from the photoobj table?
