Original Query:
SELECT T1.veldisperr FROM specobj AS T1 JOIN photoobj AS T2 ON T1.bestobjid = T2.objid WHERE T2.cmodelmag_u != 13.8112
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the velocity dispersion error values for all spectroscopic objects where the corresponding best object in the photometric data does not have a cmodelmag_u value of 13.8112.
(1) Retrieve the velocity dispersion error from the spectroscopic objects table for objects where the cmodel magnitude in the u band is not equal to 13.8112 by joining it with the photoobj table using bestobjid.
(2) Get the velocity dispersion error from the spectroscopic objects table for objects that have a cmodel magnitude in the u band not equal to 13.8112, using a join with the photometric objects table where the bestobjid matches the objid.
(3) Get the velocity dispersion error from the spectroscopic objects table for all objects where the u-band cmodel magnitude is not equal to 13.8112 in the photoobj table, and join them on their best object IDs.
(4) Retrieve the velocity dispersion error for all spectroscopic objects whose corresponding best photometric object has a cmodel magnitude in the u band not equal to 13.8112.
(5) Find the velocity dispersion error for objects in the spectroscopic catalog that have a best match with an object in the photometric catalog and where the cmodel magnitude in u band is not equal to 13.8112.
(6) What is the velocity dispersion error for all spectroscopic objects that have a best object ID matching an object ID in the photoobj table, where the cmodelmag_u value is not equal to 13.8112?
(7) What is the velocity dispersion error for spectroscopic objects that have a best object ID matching with a photometric object whose cmodel magnitude in the u band is not equal to 13.8112?
