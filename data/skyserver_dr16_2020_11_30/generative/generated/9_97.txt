Original Query:
SELECT T1.specobjid FROM spplines AS T1 JOIN specobj AS T2 ON T1.specobjid = T2.specobjid WHERE T2.segue2_target1 != -2147483644
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the specobjid for all spplines where the segue2_target1 value in the corresponding row of specobj is not equal to -2147483644.
(1) Find the specobjid values from the Stellar_spectal_line_indices table where the corresponding Spectroscopic_objects have a segue2_target1 value that is not equal to -2147483644.
(2) What is the specobjid for all spplines where the corresponding Spectroscopic_objects have a segue2_target1 value different from -2147483644?
(3) Find the specobjid of stellar spectral line indices for spectroscopic objects that have a segue2_target1 value other than -2147483644.
(4) Find the specobjid values from the spplines table where the corresponding row in the specobj table has a segue2_target1 value that is not equal to -2147483644.
(5) Find the specobjid values from the spplines table that correspond to spectroscopic objects with a segue2_target1 value not equal to -2147483644 in the specobj table.
(6) What are the specobjid values from the Stellar_spectal_line_indices table where the segue2_target1 value in the associated Spectroscopic_objects table is not equal to -2147483644?
(7) Find the specobjid from the spplines table for objects in the Spectroscopic_objects table that have a segue2_target1 value that is not equal to -2147483644.
