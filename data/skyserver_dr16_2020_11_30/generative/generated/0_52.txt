GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the g-band cmodel magnitude of photometric objects from the photoobj table where the extinction_r value is equal to 0.007540975.
(1) What is the cmodel magnitude in the g-band for Photometric objects with an extinction value of 0.007540975 in the photoobj table?
(2) Retrieve the cmodelmag_g value from the photoobj table for objects with an extinction_r value of 0.007540975 in the Photometric_objects group.
(3) Retrieve the cmodel magnitude in the g band from the Photometric_objects table of photoobj, where the extinction value in the r band is 0.007540975.
(4) Find the cmodel magnitude in the g band for all photometric objects where the extinction in the r band is equal to 0.007540975.
(5) What is the g-band CModel magnitude of Photometric_objects in the photoobj table where the extinction value for r-band is equal to 0.007540975?
(6) Retrieve the g-band cmodel magnitudes for all objects in the photoobj table where the extinction_r column in Photometric_objects is equal to 0.007540975.
(7) What is the cmodel magnitude in the g band for all photometric objects where the extinction in r band is equal to 0.007540975?
