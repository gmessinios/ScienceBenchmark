Original Query:
SELECT T1.special_target1 FROM specobj AS T1 JOIN photoobj AS T2 ON T1.bestobjid = T2.objid WHERE T2.rowc != 50.88836
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Get the special_target1 value from Spectroscopic_objects for rows where Photometric_objects.rowc is not equal to 50.88836 and the bestobjid from Spectroscopic_objects matches the objid from Photometric_objects.
(1) Retrieve the value of the "special_target1" attribute from the table "specobj" for all objects whose corresponding rowc value in the table "photoobj" is not equal to 50.88836.
(2) Retrieve the special target 1 value for spectroscopic objects that have a bestobjid matching an objid in photoobj where the rowc is not equal to 50.88836.
(3) "Find the special target1 for all spectroscopic objects where the corresponding bestobjid in the photometric objects table does not have a rowc value of 50.88836."
(4) Get the value for the special target 1 of all spectroscopic objects where the corresponding photoobj rowc value is not equal to 50.88836.
(5) Retrieve the value in the "special_target1" column from the "Spectroscopic_objects" table for all rows where the value in the "bestobjid" column in the "specobj" table matches with the value in the "objid" column in the "photoobj" table and exclude any rows where the value in the "rowc" column in the "Photometric_objects" table is equal to 50.88836.
(6) Retrieve the value of the special_target1 column for all objects from the Spectroscopic_objects table, joined with the Photometric_objects table where the bestobjid in Spectroscopic_objects matches the objid in Photometric_objects and excluding any rows where rowc in Photometric_objects is equal to 50.88836.
(7) Retrieve the special target 1 value for spectroscopic objects where the rowc value of their best photometric object does not equal 50.88836.
