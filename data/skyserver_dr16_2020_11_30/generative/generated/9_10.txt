Original Query:
SELECT T1.specobjid FROM galspecline AS T1 JOIN specobj AS T2 ON T1.specobjid = T2.specobjid WHERE T2.subclass != "K7"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the specobjid for all emission line estimates from galspecline where the corresponding spectroscopic object's subclass is not "K7".
(1) Find the specobjid of objects in the Emission_line_estimates table that are not classified as K7 in the Spectroscopic_objects table.
(2) Find the specobjid from the galspecline table where the subclass of its corresponding Spectroscopic object is not "K7".
(3) Find the specobjid values from the Emission_line_estimates table where the corresponding row in the specobj table has a subclass value that is not "K7".
(4) Select the specobjid of all Emission_line_estimates where the corresponding Spectroscopic_objects have a subclass that is not "K7".
(5) Retrieve the specobjid from the Emission_line_estimates table where the subclass in the Spectroscopic_objects table is not equal to "K7".
(6) Retrieve the specobjid from the Emission_line_estimates table for all objects in the Spectroscopic_objects table that do not have a subclass of "K7".
(7) Find the specobjid values from the galspecline table where the subclass in the corresponding row of the specobj table is not equal to "K7".
