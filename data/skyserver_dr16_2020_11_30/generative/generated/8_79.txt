Original Query:
SELECT T1.loadversion FROM specobj AS T1 WHERE T1.zerr != 5.254633e-07
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the load version from the Spectroscopic_objects table for objects in the specobj table that do not have a redshift error of 5.254633e-07.
(1) Retrieve the version number from the "loadversion" column of the "specobj" table where the value in the "zerr" column is not equal to 5.254633e-07 for objects in spectroscopic data.
(2) Retrieve the load version from the table "specobj" for objects in the spectroscopic category that have a redshift error value not equal to 5.254633e-07.
(3) What is the loadversion of Spectroscopic_objects from the specobj table where the zerr is not equal to 5.254633e-07?
(4) Retrieve the load version from the Spectroscopic_objects table where the zerr column is not equal to 5.254633e-07.
(5) What is the load version for spectroscopic objects in the specobj table, excluding those with a redshift error of 5.254633e-07?
(6) What is the load version of all objects in the specobj table where the zerr value is not equal to 5.254633e-07?
(7) Retrieve the loadversion column from the specobj table for all rows in the Spectroscopic_objects table where the zerr column is not equal to 5.254633e-07.
