Original Query:
SELECT T1.g FROM photoobj AS T1 JOIN specobj AS T2 ON T1.objid = T2.bestobjid WHERE T2.segue2primary != 1
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the g magnitude from the Photometric_objects table for all objects where the bestobjid in the Spectroscopic_objects table does not have a segue2primary value of 1.
(1) Retrieve the 'g' column from the 'photoobj' table for all objects where the 'bestobjid' column in the 'specobj' table does not match with the 'segue2primary' value of 1.
(2) Retrieve the "g" column from the "photoobj" table for all objects where the value in the "bestobjid" column of the "specobj" table does not match any value in the "segue2primary" column and both tables share a common value in the "objid" column.
(3) Retrieve the "g" column from the "photoobj" table where the object ID in the "bestobjid" column of the "specobj" table is not equal to 1 and is joined with the object ID in the "objid" column of the "photometric_objects" table.
(4) "Select the 'g' value from the photoobj table for objects where the objid matches the bestobjid in the specobj table, but only include objects where segue2primary is not equal to 1."
(5) Retrieve the g magnitude from the photoobj table for objects that have a matching bestobjid in the specobj table where segue2primary is not equal to 1.
(6) Retrieve the "g" column from the "photoobj" table for all rows where the "bestobjid" column in the "specobj" table does not match any rows with a value of 1 in the "segue2primary" column.
(7) Retrieve the g-band magnitude of all objects from the photoobj table that have a matching objid in both the photoobj and specobj tables, where those objects do not have a segue2primary value of 1 in the specobj table.
