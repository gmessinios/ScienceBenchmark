Original Query:
SELECT T1.subclass FROM specobj AS T1    ORDER BY T1.ancillary_target1 DESC LIMIT 1
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the subclass of the spectroscopic object with the highest value for the ancillary target1 column, and return only that subclass.
(1) What is the subclass of the spectroscopic object with the highest value for ancillary target 1?
(2) "Show the subclass of spectroscopic objects in the specobj table, ordering them by their ancillary target 1 in descending order and only displaying the top result."
(3) Find the subclass of the spectroscopic object with the highest value for the ancillary_target1 column in the specobj table, and display only that subclass in ascending order.
(4) What is the subclass of the first spectroscopic object in descending order by its ancillary target 1?
(5) What is the subclass of the spectroscopic object with the highest value in its ancillary_target1 column?
(6) Find the subclass of the highest value in the ancillary_target1 column for all rows in the specobj table, and order them in descending order, returning only one result.
(7) What is the subclass of the object with the highest value in the ancillary_target1 column in the specobj table?
