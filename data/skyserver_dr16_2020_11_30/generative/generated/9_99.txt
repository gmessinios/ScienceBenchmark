Original Query:
SELECT T1.specobjid FROM galspecline AS T1 JOIN specobj AS T2 ON T1.specobjid = T2.specobjid WHERE T2.segue2primary != 0
GPT-3 choices:
(0) What is the specobjid for objects in the galspecline table that have a corresponding entry in the specobj table where the segue2primary column is not equal to 0?
(1) Find the specobjid for each emission line estimate where the corresponding spectroscopic object has a segue2primary value that is not equal to 0.
(2) Retrieve the specobjid values from the Emission_line_estimates table for all spectroscopic objects that have a segue2primary value not equal to zero in the specobj table.
(3) Find the specobjid values from the galspecline table where the corresponding row in the specobj table has a segue2primary value not equal to 0.
(4) What are the specobjid values for the emission line estimates where the segue2primary value in the corresponding spectroscopic object is not equal to 0?
(5) Retrieve the specobjid values from the galspecline table where the segue2primary column in the specobj table is not equal to 0.
(6) Retrieve the specobjid values from the Emission_line_estimates table where the corresponding Spectroscopic_objects entry has a non-zero segue2primary value.
(7) Find the specobjid of all emission lines where the corresponding spectroscopic object is not a primary object in the Segue2 survey.
