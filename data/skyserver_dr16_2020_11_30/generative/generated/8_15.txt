Original Query:
SELECT T1.survey FROM specobj AS T1 WHERE T1.veldisp != 137.458
GPT-3 choices:
(0) What is the survey name of all spectroscopic objects with a velocity dispersion that is not equal to 137.458?
(1) What is the survey of spectroscopic objects in which the velocity dispersion is not equal to 137.458?
