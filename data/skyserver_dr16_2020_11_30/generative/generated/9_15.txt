Original Query:
SELECT T1.colc FROM photoobj AS T1 JOIN neighbors AS T2 ON T1.objid = T2.objid WHERE T2.mode != 1
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the color column (colc) from the photoobj table for all objects in Photometric_objects that have an objid that matches an objid in the neighbors table, where the mode of those neighboring objects is not equal to 1.
(1) Retrieve the "colc" column from the "photoobj" table for all objects where the corresponding object ID in the "neighbors" table does not have a mode value of 1.
(2) Find the color measurements of photometric objects where the mode of their nearest neighbor objects is not equal to 1.
(3) Find the color of photometric objects where their object identifier matches with that of nearest neighbor objects but only include those where the mode is not equal to 1.
(4) Get the color of photometric objects where their objid is equal to the objid in neighbors table, but only if the mode in Nearest_neighbour_objects is not equal to 1.
(5) Find the color value for each object in the photometric objects table that has an object ID that matches a neighbor's object ID from the neighbors table, where the neighbor's mode is not equal to 1.
(6) Retrieve the colc value from the photoobj table for objects that have an objid in both the Photometric_objects and Nearest_neighbour_objects tables, where the mode in Nearest_neighbour_objects is not equal to 1.
(7) Retrieve the column "colc" from the table "photoobj" for objects in the table "neighbors" whose object ID does not have a mode of 1.
