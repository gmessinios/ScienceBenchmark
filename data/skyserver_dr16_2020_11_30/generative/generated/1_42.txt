Original Query:
SELECT T1.specobjid FROM galspecline AS T1 JOIN specobj AS T2 ON T1.specobjid = T2.specobjid WHERE T2.segue2primary = 0
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the specobjid values from the Emission_line_estimates table where the Spectroscopic_objects table has a segue2primary value of 0.
(1) Retrieve the specobjid for all Emission_line_estimates where segue2primary is equal to 0 and join it with specobj on the condition that the specobjid values match.
(2) Retrieve the specobjid values from the galspecline table for all spectroscopic objects that are not classified as segue2primary in the specobj table.
(3) Get the specobjid from the table Emission_line_estimates for all rows where segue2primary is not equal to 0 in the table Spectroscopic_objects.
(4) Select the specobjid from Emission_line_estimates where Spectroscopic_objects.segue2primary is equal to 0, and join it with specobj from Spectroscopic_objects.
(5) Find the spectral object IDs from the table "galspecline" for all spectroscopic objects that are not primary in the "specobj" table.
(6) Retrieve the specobjid from Emission_line_estimates where the corresponding entry in the Spectroscopic_objects table has a value of 0 for segue2primary.
(7) Retrieve the specobjid values from the Emission_line_estimates table for all spectroscopic objects in the Spectroscopic_objects table that are not associated with a SEGUE2 primary object.
