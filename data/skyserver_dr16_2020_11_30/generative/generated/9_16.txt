Original Query:
SELECT T1.description FROM photo_type AS T1 JOIN neighbors AS T2 ON T1.value = T2.neighbortype WHERE T2.neighbortype != 6
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the description of all photometrically observed objects from the table "photo_type" that have a value matching the neighbor type of any object in the "neighbors" table, excluding those with a neighbor type of 6.
(1) Retrieve the descriptions of photometrically observed objects that are not type 6, based on the nearest neighbor objects' types.
(2) Find the description of photometrically observed objects that are not classified as type 6 in the neighbors table.
(3) What are the descriptions of photometrically observed objects for which the nearest neighbor type is not 6?
(4) Get the descriptions of photometrically observed objects that are not type 6 according to the list of nearest neighbor objects.
(5) Get the description of objects that have been observed using photometric methods, but are not of type 6, based on their closest neighbor.
(6) Get the description of all objects that have been observed photometrically and are not of type 6, based on their closest neighbor.
(7) Retrieve the description of photometrically observed photo types for all neighbor objects that do not have a neighbor type value of 6.
