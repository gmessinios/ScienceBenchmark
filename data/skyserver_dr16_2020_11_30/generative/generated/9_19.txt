Original Query:
SELECT T1.name FROM photo_type AS T1 JOIN photoobj AS T2 ON T1.value = T2.type WHERE T2.rowc != 52.44669
GPT-3 choices:
(0) What are the names of all objects that have been photometrically observed but have a rowc value different from 52.44669 in the photoobj table?
(1) Retrieve the names of all objects that have been observed photometrically, and are not located at row 52.44669 on the photoobj table.
(2) Retrieve the names of all objects observed photometrically whose type does not have a rowc value of 52.44669.
(3) Find the names of objects that have been observed photometrically and have a type value that is not equal to 52.44669 in the photoobj table.
(4) Find the name of photometrically observed objects where the rowc value is not equal to 52.44669 in the photoobj table and join it with the name from the photo_type table where their type values are the same.
(5) Find the names of objects that have a photometric type matching that in the photo_type table and whose rowc value is not equal to 52.44669 in the Photometric_objects table.
(6) Retrieve the names of all objects in the photo_type table that are photometrically observed and have a type value that does not equal 52.44669 in the rowc column of the photoobj table.
(7) Find the names of objects that have a photometric type equal to the name in the table "photometrically_observed" and whose rowc value is not equal to 52.44669 in the table "Photometric_objects".
