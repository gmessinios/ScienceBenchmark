Original Query:
SELECT T1.value FROM photo_type AS T1 WHERE T1.description = "Cosmic-ray track (not used)." and T1.name = "SKY"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the numerical value of a cosmic-ray track that is described as not used and categorized under "SKY" from the photometrically_observed table.
(1) Retrieve the value from the "SKY" column of the "photometrically_observed" table where the description is "Cosmic-ray track (not used)."
(2) Retrieve the value from the "value" column of the table "photo_type" where the description is "Cosmic-ray track (not used)" and name is "SKY".
(3) Find the value of photometrically observed data for cosmic-ray tracks that are not used in the photo type, specifically for the "SKY" name.
(4) Retrieve the value from the "SKY" column of the "photo_type" table for observations that have a description of "Cosmic-ray track (not used)."
(5) Retrieve the value of the photometrically observed cosmic-ray track that is not used in the "SKY" category from the photo type database.
(6) What is the value of the photometrically observed cosmic-ray track in the SKY category that is not used?
(7) Retrieve the value for a cosmic-ray track that is not used and is observed photometrically as "SKY".
