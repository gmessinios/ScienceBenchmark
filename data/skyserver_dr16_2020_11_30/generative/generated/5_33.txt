Original Query:
SELECT T1.ancillary_target1 FROM specobj AS T1    ORDER BY T1.veldisp DESC LIMIT 1
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Select the ancillary target1 value for all spectroscopic objects and sort them in descending order by velocity dispersion, returning only the first result.
(1) Get the ancillary target1 value from the Spectroscopic_objects table, sorted by veldisp in descending order and limit to only 1 result.
(2) Get the name of the ancillary target1 from the Spectroscopic_objects table, sorting in descending order by veldisp and limiting to 1 result.
(3) "Retrieve the first ancillary target listed for the spectroscopic object with the largest velocity dispersion, ordering results in descending order by velocity dispersion and limiting to one result."
(4) Find the ancillary target1 value from the specobj table for the spectroscopic object with the highest velocity dispersion, ordered in descending order, and return only the first result.
(5) Return the first entry in the ancillary_target1 column of the specobj table, ordered by veldisp in descending order and limiting the results to one.
(6) Retrieve the value in the "ancillary_target1" column from the table "specobj" for the row with the largest "veldisp" value, ordered in descending order, limited to one result.
(7) Find the value in the "ancillary_target1" column of the "specobj" table, sorted by descending values in the "veldisp" column and limit to only one result.
