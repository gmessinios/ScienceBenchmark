GPT-3 choices:
(0) What is the count of spectroscopic objects grouped by their segue2_target1 value?
(1) Count the number of objects in the "specobj" table grouped by the value of their "segue2_target1" attribute, and display both the attribute value and its corresponding count.
(2) "Count the number of spectroscopic objects in the specobj table, grouped by their segue2_target1 value."
(3) Find the number of spectroscopic objects for each segue2 target in the Spectroscopic_objects table.
(4) Find the number of occurrences for each unique value in the "segue2_target1" column from the "specobj" table.
(5) What is the count of objects in the "specobj" table grouped by their "segue2_target1" value?
(6) How many spectroscopic objects are there in the specobj table and what is the count of each Segue 2 target?
(7) "Count the number of objects from the spectroscopic data table grouped by their SEGUE2 target and list the target with its corresponding count."
