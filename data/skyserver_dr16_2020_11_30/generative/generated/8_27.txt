###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.subclass FROM specobj AS T1 WHERE T1.dec != -16.682353
GPT-3 choices:
(0) What are the subclass values for all objects in the specobj table where the declination value is not equal to -16.682353?
(1) What subclass is associated with spectroscopic objects that do not have a declination of -16.682353?
(2) Retrieve the subclass attribute from the Spectroscopic_objects table for objects with a declination value not equal to -16.682353.
(3) Retrieve the subclass of all spectroscopic objects where the declination is not equal to -16.682353.
(4) Retrieve the subclass of objects in the specobj table where the declination is not equal to -16.682353.
(5) Find the subclass for all spectroscopic objects where the declination is not -16.682353.
(6) Select the subclass of spectroscopic objects where the declination is not equal to -16.682353 from a table called specobj and rename it as Spectroscopic_objects.
(7) Find the subclass of all spectroscopic objects where their declination is not -16.682353.
