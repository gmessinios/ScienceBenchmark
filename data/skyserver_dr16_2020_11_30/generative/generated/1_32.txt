Original Query:
SELECT T1.specobjid FROM spplines AS T1 JOIN specobj AS T2 ON T1.specobjid = T2.specobjid WHERE T2.subclass = "B0IVe (5394)"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) What is the specobjid for objects with a subclass of "B0IVe (5394)" in the table spplines?
(1) Find the specobjid of all objects in the spplines table that have a subclass of "B0IVe (5394)" in the specobj table.
(2) Find the specobjid from the Stellar_spectal_line_indices table where the subclass in the Spectroscopic_objects table is equal to "B0IVe (5394)".
(3) Retrieve the specobjid from the spplines table where subclass in the specobj table is equal to "B0IVe (5394)".
(4) Retrieve the specobjid from the Stellar_spectal_line_indices table where the corresponding Spectroscopic_objects record has a subclass value of "B0IVe (5394)".
(5) Retrieve the specobjid values from the spplines table for all spectroscopic objects in the Spectroscopic_objects table that have a subclass of "B0IVe (5394)".
(6) Retrieve the specobjid from spplines for any Spectroscopic_objects with a subclass of "B0IVe (5394)".
(7) Find the specobjid of all objects in the spplines table whose subclass in the specobj table is "B0IVe (5394)".
