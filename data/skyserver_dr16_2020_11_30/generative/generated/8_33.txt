(0) Find the plate IDs for all spectroscopic objects that are not considered to be the primary science target.
(1) Retrieve the plate ID from the spectroscopic objects table for objects that are not marked as primary science targets.
(2) Retrieve the plate ID of spectroscopic objects from the specobj table where the science primary flag is not equal to 1.
(3) Find the plate IDs for spectroscopic objects that are not labeled as science primary.
(4) Retrieve the plate IDs of all spectroscopic objects that are not considered primary science targets.
(5) Select the plate ID from the spectroscopic objects table where the science primary column is not equal to 1.
(6) Retrieve the plate IDs from the specobj table for all objects that are not marked as primary science targets.
(7) Find the plateid for all spectroscopic objects that are not designated as a primary science object.
