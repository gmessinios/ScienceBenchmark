Original Query:
SELECT T1.ra FROM specobj AS T1    ORDER BY T1.plateid DESC LIMIT 1
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the right ascension data for the last plate used in spectroscopic observations, ordered from highest to lowest.
(1) What is the right ascension of the last recorded spectroscopic object, when sorted by plate ID in descending order?
(2) Retrieve the right ascension values of all objects in the specobj table, sorted by plateid in descending order, and limit the results to only one row.
(3) What is the right ascension of the last spectroscopic object in the specobj table, when sorted by plateid in descending order?
(4) What is the right ascension of the most recently observed spectroscopic object in the specobj table, sorted by plate ID?
(5) Find the right ascension of the last spectroscopic object in the database, ordered by plate ID.
(6) Retrieve the right ascension values from the "specobj" table, under the alias "Spectroscopic_objects", ordered in descending order by plate ID, with a limit of 1.
(7) "Get the right ascension values for all objects in the table specobj, ordering them by plateid in descending order and selecting only the first one."
