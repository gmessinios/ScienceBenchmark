Original Query:
SELECT T1.neighborobjid FROM neighbors AS T1 WHERE T1.mode = 1 or T1.neighbortype = 0
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the object IDs of nearest neighbor objects where the mode is 1 or the neighbor type is 0 from a table called "neighbors".
(1) Get the IDs of the nearest neighbor objects from the "neighbors" table where the mode is equal to 1 or the neighbor type is equal to 0.
(2) Find the ID of the nearest neighbor objects where either the mode is 1 or the neighbor type is equal to 0.
(3) Find the object IDs of nearest neighbors where either the mode is equal to 1 or the neighbor type is equal to 0.
(4) Find the nearest neighbor objects that either have a mode of 1 or a neighbor type of 0 in the neighbors table, and return their object IDs from the Nearest_neighbour_objects table.
(5) Find the neighbor object ID of the nearest neighbour objects where the mode is equal to 1 or the neighbortype is equal to 0 from the neighbors table.
(6) Get the neighbor object IDs for objects with a mode value of 1 or a neighbor type value of 0 from the "neighbors" table.
(7) Retrieve the neighbor object ID for objects in the neighbors table where the mode is equal to 1 or the neighbor type is equal to 0.
