SELECT Photometric_objects.objid FROM photoobj AS Photometric_objects JOIN photo_type AS photometrically_observed ON Photometric_objects.type = photometrically_observed.value WHERE photometrically_observed.name != "STAR"

###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.objid FROM photoobj AS T1 JOIN photo_type AS T2 ON T1.type = T2.value WHERE T2.name != "STAR"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Get the objid from the photoobj table for all objects that have been observed photometrically and are not classified as stars.
(1) Retrieve the objid from the Photometric_objects table for objects that have been observed photometrically and are not classified as stars.
(2) Retrieve the object IDs from the photoobj table for objects that have been observed photometrically, where the type of object is not a star.
(3) Find the object ID of all objects in the photoobj table that have been observed photometrically and are not classified as stars according to the photo_type table.
(4) Find the objid for all Photometric_objects that have a type other than "STAR" in the photoobj table, joining with the photometrically_observed table on the condition that their values are equal.
(5) Find the objid of objects from the photoobj table that have been observed photometrically and whose type is not equal to "STAR".
(6) Retrieve the object identification numbers of all objects observed photometrically, excluding those classified as stars.
(7) Retrieve the object IDs of all photometric objects that have been observed as something other than a star.
