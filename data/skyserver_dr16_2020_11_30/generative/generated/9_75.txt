GPT-3 choices:
(0) What is the type of nearest neighbour objects that have been photometrically observed, excluding those with the name "KNOWNOBJ"?
(1) Find the type of objects that are nearest neighbours to each other, excluding those that have been photometrically observed as "KNOWNOBJ".
(2) Find the type of nearest neighbor objects that have been observed photometrically and are not known objects.
(3) Retrieve the type of objects that are neighbors to known objects and have been photometrically observed.
(4) Retrieve the types of nearest neighbour objects that have been photometrically observed, excluding those with a type of "KNOWNOBJ".
(5) Find the type of nearest neighbor objects that have been photometrically observed, but are not known objects.
(6) Retrieve the type of objects that are the nearest neighbors to photometrically observed objects, excluding those with a value of "KNOWNOBJ".
(7) Retrieve the type of nearest neighbour objects that have been photometrically observed, excluding those with the name "KNOWNOBJ".
