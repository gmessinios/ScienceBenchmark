Original Query:
SELECT T1.specobjid FROM galspecline AS T1 JOIN specobj AS T2 ON T1.specobjid = T2.specobjid WHERE T2.fiberid != 446
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the specobjid from the Emission_line_estimates table where the fiberid in the Spectroscopic_objects table is not equal to 446.
(1) "Select the specobjid from galspecline where the corresponding fiberid in specobj is not equal to 446."
(2) Find the specobjid for all Emission_line_estimates where the corresponding Spectroscopic_objects do not have a fiberid of 446.
(3) Retrieve the specobjid from Emission_line_estimates where the fiberid is not equal to 446 in the corresponding entry in Spectroscopic_objects.
(4) Retrieve the specobjid values from the galspecline table where the corresponding fiberid value in the specobj table is not equal to 446.
(5) Find the specobjid of all Spectroscopic_objects that have an Emission_line_estimate and do not have a fiberid of 446.
(6) Find the specobjid from the Emission_line_estimates table where the fiberid is not equal to 446 in the Spectroscopic_objects table.
(7) Retrieve the specobjid values from the Emission_line_estimates table where the corresponding Spectroscopic_objects.fiberid value is not equal to 446.
