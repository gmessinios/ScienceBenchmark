Original Query:
SELECT T1.clean FROM photoobj AS T1 JOIN photo_type AS T2 ON T1.type = T2.value WHERE T2.description != "KnownObject: Object came from some other catalog (not the SDSS catalog). (not yet used)"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the "clean" column from the "photoobj" table for objects that have been photometrically observed and are not labeled as coming from a catalog other than SDSS.
(1) Find the clean values from the photoobj table for photometric objects that have been observed and are not from another catalog.
(2) Find all clean photometric objects from the photoobj table that have been classified as photometrically observed in the photo_type table, excluding those labeled as known objects from a different catalog.
(3) Find the clean column from the photoobj table for objects that are described as being photometrically observed but not from another catalog in the photo_type table.
(4) Find the clean column from the Photometric_objects table where the type matches a value in the photo_type table and the description does not equal "KnownObject: Object came from some other catalog (not the SDSS catalog). (not yet used)".
(5) Retrieve the clean attribute from the Photometric_objects table for objects that have been photometrically observed, excluding those that have come from a different catalog.
(6) Get the clean value from the photoobj table for all objects that have a type matching a description in the photometrically_observed table, where the description is not "KnownObject: Object came from some other catalog (not the SDSS catalog). (not yet used)".
(7) Retrieve the clean column from the Photometric_objects table where the type matches a value in the photo_type table, but exclude any objects that have a description of "KnownObject: Object came from some other catalog (not the SDSS catalog)".
