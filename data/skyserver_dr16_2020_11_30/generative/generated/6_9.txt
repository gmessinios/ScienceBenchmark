GPT-3 choices:
(0) Get the object IDs of nearest neighbors that have a mode of 1 and a neighbor type of 6.
(1) Find the object IDs of nearest neighbour objects that are in mode 1 and have a neighbour type of 6.
(2) Find the object IDs of the nearest neighbors that have a mode value of 1 and a neighbor type of 6 in the "neighbors" table.
(3) Find the object IDs of nearest neighbor objects that are in mode 1 and have a neighbor type of 6.
(4) "Find the objid of the nearest neighbour objects where the mode is equal to 1 and neighbortype is equal to 6."
(5) Retrieve the object IDs of the nearest neighbor objects with a mode of 1 and a neighbor type of 6 from the "neighbors" table.
(6) Find the object IDs of the nearest neighbor objects that are in mode 1 and have a neighbor type of 6.
(7) Find the object ID for the nearest neighbor in which the mode is 1 and neighbortype is 6.
