Original Query:
SELECT T1.name FROM photo_type AS T1 JOIN photoobj AS T2 ON T1.value = T2.type WHERE T2.dec != -17.1110510805343
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the names of all photometric objects that have a type value matching a record in the photo_type table, and whose corresponding entry in the photoobj table has a declination value not equal to -17.1110510805343.
(1) Find the names of all objects that have a photometric observation type and a declination value not equal to -17.1110510805343 in the photoobj table.
(2) Find the names of all objects that have been photometrically observed and have a type that is not equal to -17.1110510805343 in the photo_type table, and join it with the photoobj table to retrieve their corresponding names.
(3) Retrieve the name of photometrically observed objects from the photoobj table where their type value matches that of the photo_type table and their declination does not equal -17.1110510805343.
(4) Find the name of all photometric objects that have been observed and are not located at a declination of -17.1110510805343.
(5) Find the names of objects that have a photometric type equal to the value in column 'type' from table 'photoobj', but only if their declination is not equal to -17.1110510805343.
(6) Find the names of all objects that have a photometric type and a declination not equal to -17.1110510805343.
(7) Find the names of all photometrically observed objects whose type in the photoobj table is not equal to -17.1110510805343 for their declination value.
