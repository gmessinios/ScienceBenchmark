GPT-3 choices:
(0) Show me the fields from the photoobj table for photometric objects that have been observed and are not a satellite, asteroid, or meteor trail.
(1) Retrieve the field from the photoobj table for objects that have been photometrically observed but are not classified as trails.
(2) What are the fields from the photoobj table for objects that have been photometrically observed and are not classified as satellite, asteroid, or meteor trails?
(3) Find the fields from objects in the photoobj table that have been observed photometrically, excluding any that have been classified as a satellite, asteroid, or meteor trail.
(4) Find the field from the photoobj table where the object's type is marked as photometrically observed and the description is not "Trail: A satellite or asteroid or meteor trail".
(5) Retrieve the field of all objects from the Photometric_objects table that have been classified as photometrically observed, excluding trails.
(6) Find the fields from the Photometric_objects table where the type is equal to a value in the photo_type table with a description that is not "Trail: A satellite or asteroid or meteor trail. (not yet used)".
(7) Find the fields of photometric objects that have been observed through photometry, excluding trails.
