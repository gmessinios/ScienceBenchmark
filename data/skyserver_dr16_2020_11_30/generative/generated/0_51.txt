(1) Retrieve the value of the "photometrically observed" measurement for cosmic-ray tracks that are not used.
(2) "Retrieve the value of photometrically observed cosmic-ray tracks that are not used."
(3) What is the value for cosmic-ray tracks that are not used, as described in the photo type table?
(4) "Retrieve the value from the table photometrically_observed where the description is 'Cosmic-ray track (not used)'."
(5) What is the value of the cosmic-ray track (not used) in the photometrically observed photo type?
(6) Retrieve the value from the photometrically_observed table where the description is "Cosmic-ray track (not used)".
(7) Retrieve the value from the column "value" in the table "photo_type" where the description is equal to "Cosmic-ray track (not used)".
