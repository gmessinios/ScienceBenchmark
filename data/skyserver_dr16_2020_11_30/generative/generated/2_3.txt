Original Query:
SELECT T1.veldisperr, count(*) FROM specobj AS T1  GROUP BY T1.veldisperr
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Count the number of spectroscopic objects and their corresponding velocity dispersion errors, grouped by velocity dispersion error.
(1) Find the number of occurrences for each value in the column "veldisperr" in the table "specobj" and group them together.
(2) Count the number of rows in the table specobj, grouping them by the values in the column veldisperr and listing the corresponding value for each group.
(3) Find the velocity dispersion error and count the number of spectroscopic objects in the "specobj" table, grouping them by the velocity dispersion error.
(4) Count the number of objects in the "specobj" table and group them by their velocity dispersion error, then select the velocity dispersion error and its corresponding count for each group.
(5) "How many spectroscopic objects are there for each velocity dispersion error, and what is the total count for each unique value?"
(6) Count the number of spectroscopic objects and their corresponding velocity dispersion error values from the specobj table and group them by the velocity dispersion error values.
(7) What is the count of the velocity dispersion error for each spectroscopic object in the specobj table?
