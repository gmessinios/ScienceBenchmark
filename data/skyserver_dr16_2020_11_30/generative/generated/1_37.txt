SELECT Photometric_objects.mjd FROM photoobj AS Photometric_objects JOIN neighbors AS Nearest_neighbour_objects ON Photometric_objects.objid = Nearest_neighbour_objects.objid WHERE Nearest_neighbour_objects.mode = 1

###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.mjd FROM photoobj AS T1 JOIN neighbors AS T2 ON T1.objid = T2.objid WHERE T2.mode = 1
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the modified Julian date of objects from the photometric database for all nearest neighbor objects in which their mode is equal to 1.
(1) Find the MJD values for all Photometric objects where the corresponding objid also appears in the neighbors table with a mode value of 1.
(2) Retrieve the modified Julian date of photometric objects from the photoobj table, joining it with the neighbors table on matching objid values and filtering for only those with a mode value of 1.
(3) Retrieve the mjd values for all photometric objects that have a nearest neighbor object with mode equal to 1.
(4) Retrieve the Modified Julian Date of all photometric objects where the nearest neighbor object's mode is equal to 1.
(5) What is the modified Julian date (mjd) of photometric objects where their object id matches with the nearest neighbour objects and their mode is equal to 1?
(6) Get the Modified Julian Date for all Photometric objects that have a nearest neighbor with mode 1.
(7) Find the modified Julian date of all objects in the photometric dataset that have a nearest neighbor in the same dataset and where the mode of the nearest neighbor is equal to 1.
