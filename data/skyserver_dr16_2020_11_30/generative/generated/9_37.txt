Original Query:
SELECT T1.value FROM photo_type AS T1 JOIN photoobj AS T2 ON T1.value = T2.type WHERE T2.ra != 0.0165372075736627
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Get the photometrically observed values from photo types for objects in the photoobj table that have a non-zero ra value.
(1) Find the values of photometrically observed photo types for all Photometric objects where the right ascension is not equal to 0.0165372075736627.
(2) Find the value of the photometrically observed object from the photo_type table where the type matches that of an object in the photoobj table with a non-zero right ascension.
(3) Find the value of photometrically observed type for Photometric objects where the right ascension is not equal to 0.0165372075736627.
(4) What is the value for photometrically observed objects in the photoobj table, excluding those with a right ascension of 0.0165372075736627?
(5) Retrieve the value of photometrically observed objects for all photo objects whose type does not equal 0.0165372075736627 and are associated with a non-zero right ascension.
(6) Retrieve the values from the "value" column in the "photometrically_observed" table for all objects in the "photoobj" table where the object's right ascension is not equal to 0.0165372075736627 and their type matches a value in the "type" column of the "photo_type" table.
(7) Find the value of photometrically observed objects where the type matches that of Photometric objects with a non-zero right ascension.
