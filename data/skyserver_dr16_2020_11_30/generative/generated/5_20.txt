SELECT Photometric_objects.g FROM photoobj AS Photometric_objects    ORDER BY Photometric_objects.l DESC LIMIT 1

###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.g FROM photoobj AS T1    ORDER BY T1.l DESC LIMIT 1
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Show the value of "g" for objects in the table photoobj named "Photometric_objects", ordered by the value of "l" in descending order, with a limit of 1.
(1) Find the value of column "g" from the table "photoobj", renamed as "Photometric_objects", and list it in descending order based on column "l", then limit the results to only the first row.
(2) Find the maximum value of g from the photoobj table and sort it by descending order based on l, limiting the results to only 1 row.
(3) Retrieve the g column from the photoobj table as Photometric_objects and arrange them in descending order by their l values, with only the top result being returned.
(4) Find the value for "g" from the "Photometric_objects" table in the database "photoobj", where the objects are ordered by their longitude in descending order, and only return the first result.
(5) Find the g value for the photometric object with the highest l value, ordering by descending order and limiting to 1 result.
(6) Retrieve the g-band photometric magnitude from the photoobj table, ordered by decreasing galactic longitude, with a limit of one result.
(7) Get the value of "g" from the table "photoobj" for all objects with maximum longitude, sorted in descending order and limited to 1 result.
