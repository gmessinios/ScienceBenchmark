Original Query:
SELECT T1.description FROM photo_type AS T1 JOIN photoobj AS T2 ON T1.value = T2.type WHERE T2.l = 0.0389610295497675
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the description of the photometrically observed photo type from the photoobj table where the value is equal to 0.0389610295497675 and l is equal to 0.
(1) Get the description from the "photometrically_observed" column of the "photo_type" table for objects in the "photoobj" table with a type that is equal to 0.0389610295497675 and have no measured redshift value.
(2) Retrieve the description of all photometric objects that have a type value of "photometrically observed" and a l value of 0.0389610295497675 from the photo_type and photoobj tables.
(3) Retrieve the description of the photo type for objects in the photoobj table with a value equal to 0.0389610295497675, joined with the photo_type table, which has a corresponding value in its 'type' column, representing photometrically observed objects.
(4) Find the description for all photometrically observed photo types of objects with a galactic longitude value of 0.0389610295497675 in the Photometric_objects table.
(5) What is the description of photometrically observed objects from the photo_type table where the type value matches that of Photometric_objects with an l value of 0.0389610295497675?
(6) What is the description of the photometrically observed photo type for Photometric objects with a length of 0.0389610295497675?
(7) What is the description of the photometric observation type for photometric objects with a l value of 0.0389610295497675?
