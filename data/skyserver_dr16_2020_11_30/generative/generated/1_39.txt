Original Query:
SELECT T1.objid FROM photoobj AS T1 JOIN neighbors AS T2 ON T1.objid = T2.objid WHERE T2.neighbortype = 3
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the objid of Photometric_objects where their objid is equal to Nearest_neighbour_objects' objid and Nearest_neighbour_objects' neighbortype is 3.
(1) Find the objid of all objects in the photoobj table that have a neighbortype value of 3 in the neighbors table.
(2) Retrieve the object identification numbers for all objects in the photoobj table that have a neighbor type of 3 in the neighbors table and are also present in both tables.
(3) Find the object ID for all photometric objects from the photoobj table that have a nearest neighbor with a neighbor type of 3 in the neighbors table.
(4) Find the object IDs from the table of photometric objects where the object IDs are equal to the object IDs in the neighbor table, and the neighbor type is 3.
(5) Find the object ID for all Photometric objects that have a nearest neighbor with a neighbortype of 3 in the neighbors table.
(6) Find the object IDs from a table of photometric objects that match the object IDs in another table of nearest neighbor objects where the neighbor type is 3.
(7) Find the objid for all Photometric_objects from the photoobj table that have a neighbortype of 3 in the neighbors table.
