Original Query:
SELECT T1.z FROM photoobj AS T1 JOIN neighbors AS T2 ON T1.objid = T2.objid WHERE T2.type != 3
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the redshift (z) values from the photometric_objects table for objects that have a nearest neighbor object with a type other than 3.
(1) Retrieve the redshift values from the photoobj table for all objects that have a nearest neighbor object with a type other than 3 in the neighbors table.
(2) Find the redshift values of all objects in the photoobj table whose objid also appears in the neighbors table, but only if their type is not equal to 3.
(3) Find the redshift value from the Photometric_objects table for objects that have a type different from 3 in the Nearest_neighbour_objects table.
(4) Retrieve the redshift value from the Photometric_objects table for objects where the type of their nearest neighbor, as found in the Nearest_neighbour_objects table, is not equal to 3.
(5) Find the redshift value of all photometric objects that have a nearest neighbor which is not a type 3 object.
(6) Retrieve the redshift value for all Photometric objects whose object ID matches with the Nearest neighbor objects' object ID, excluding any Nearest neighbor objects with a type value of 3.
(7) What is the redshift value for all objects in the photometric_objects table where their object ID matches with an object ID in the neighbors table but have a type that is not equal to 3?
