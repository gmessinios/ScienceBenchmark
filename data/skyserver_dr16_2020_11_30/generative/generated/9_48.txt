Original Query:
SELECT T1.specobjid FROM galspecline AS T1 JOIN specobj AS T2 ON T1.specobjid = T2.specobjid WHERE T2.zerr != 3.571396e-06
GPT-3 choices:
(0) What are the specobjids from the galspecline table where the corresponding spectroscopic objects have a zerr value that is not equal to 3.571396e-06?
(1) Find the specobjid values from the Emission_line_estimates table where the corresponding Spectroscopic_objects have a zerr value that is not equal to 3.571396e-06.
(2) Find the specobjid of emission line estimates from the galspecline table, for which the corresponding Spectroscopic_object's zerr value is not equal to 3.571396e-06.
(3) What are the specobjids for all objects in the Emission_line_estimates table that have a zerr value different than 3.571396e-06 in the Spectroscopic_objects table?
(4) Find the specobjid from the galspecline table where the zerr value in the corresponding row of the specobj table is not equal to 3.571396e-06.
(5) Find the specobjid for Emission_line_estimates where the zerr value is not equal to 3.571396e-06 in the galspecline table, joined with the specobj table on their shared specobjid.
(6) What are the specobjid values from the Emission_line_estimates table where the corresponding Spectroscopic_objects have a zerr value that is not equal to 3.571396e-06?
(7) Retrieve the specobjid from the Emission_line_estimates table for all rows where the zerr column in the Spectroscopic_objects table is not equal to 3.571396e-06.
