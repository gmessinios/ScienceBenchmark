Original Query:
SELECT T1.cmodelmag_u, count(*) FROM photoobj AS T1  GROUP BY T1.cmodelmag_u
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the count of objects in the Photometric_objects table grouped by their cmodelmag_u values, and also include their corresponding cmodelmag_u values.
(1) What is the count of Photometric objects with a cmodel magnitude in the u-band?
(2) Count the number of objects in the photoobj table and group them by their cmodelmag_u value, returning the corresponding u-band magnitude for each object.
(3) Find the count of objects in the photoobj table grouped by their cmodelmag_u value, and also include the corresponding cmodelmag_u value for each group.
(4) How many objects have a cmodelmag_u value and what is the count for each distinct value in the Photometric_objects table in the photoobj database?
(5) How many photometric objects are there and what is the average cmodelmag_u for each of them?
(6) Count the number of objects and their corresponding cmodelmag_u values in the photoobj table, grouped by the cmodelmag_u values, from the Photometric_objects table.
(7) Find the count of objects in the photoobj table grouped by their cmodelmag_u values and also retrieve their corresponding cmodelmag_u values.
