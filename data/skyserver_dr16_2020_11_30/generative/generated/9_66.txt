Original Query:
SELECT T1.run FROM photoobj AS T1 JOIN specobj AS T2 ON T1.objid = T2.bestobjid WHERE T2.special_target1 != 0
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the run from the photoobj table for objects that have a non-zero value in the special_target1 column of the specobj table.
(1) What is the run number for all objects in the photoobj table whose objid matches the bestobjid in the specobj table, where those objects have a non-zero value for special_target1?
(2) Find the run numbers for photometric objects where the bestobjid in the spectroscopic_objects table is not equal to 0.
(3) Find the runs of photometric objects that have a matching objid in photoobj and bestobjid in specobj, where Spectroscopic_objects.special_target1 is not equal to 0.
(4) Retrieve the runs from the photoobj table where the objid in Photometric_objects matches the bestobjid in specobj and where special_target1 in Spectroscopic_objects is not equal to 0.
(5) "Retrieve the name of the run for all Photometric objects that have a corresponding Spectroscopic object with a non-zero special target 1."
(6) Find the runs from the Photometric_objects table where there exists a match in the Spectroscopic_objects table based on their objid and the special_target1 column is not equal to 0.
(7) Retrieve the run number for all photometric objects that have a corresponding entry in the specobj table and whose special_target1 value is not equal to 0.
