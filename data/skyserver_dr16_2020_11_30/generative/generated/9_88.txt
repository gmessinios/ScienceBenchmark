Original Query:
SELECT T1.cmodelmag_u FROM photoobj AS T1 JOIN photo_type AS T2 ON T1.type = T2.value WHERE T2.name != "GHOST"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the cmodelmag_u value from the Photometric_objects table for objects that have been observed photometrically, excluding those labeled as "GHOST" in the photo_type table.
(1) Find the cmodelmag_u values from the photoobj table for objects that have been observed photometrically and are not classified as "GHOST".
(2) Retrieve the cmodelmag_u value for all objects from the photoobj table that have been photometrically observed, excluding those that have a type of "GHOST".
(3) "Retrieve the cmodel magnitude values in the u-band from Photometric_objects for all objects that have been photometrically observed and are not classified as GHOST."
(4) Find the CModel u-band magnitude for photometric objects that have been observed using photometry but not identified as GHOST.
(5) Find the cmodel magnitude in the u band for all photometric objects where the type is not equal to "GHOST".
(6) Get the u-band model magnitude from Photometric_objects for objects that have been observed photometrically and are not categorized as "GHOST" in the photo_type table.
(7) Retrieve the u-band cmodel magnitudes of photometric objects that have been observed through photometric means, excluding any objects labeled as "GHOST".
