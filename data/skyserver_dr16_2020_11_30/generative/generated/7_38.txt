Original Query:
SELECT T1.extinction_r FROM photoobj AS T1 WHERE T1.dec = -18.8098484043374 or T1.clean = 0
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the extinction value in the r-band for all objects with a declination of -18.8098484043374 or a cleanliness flag of 0 from the photoobj table.
(1) Retrieve the extinction value for objects in the photoobj table with a declination of -18.8098484043374 or that have been identified as unclean.
(2) Retrieve the value of extinction_r from the photoobj table for objects with a declination of -18.8098484043374 or a clean value of 0.
(3) Get the extinction in r-band for all objects where the declination is equal to -18.8098484043374 or the clean flag is equal to 0 from the photoobj table.
(4) What is the extinction in the r band for objects with a declination of -18.8098484043374 or that are not considered clean in the photometric data?
(5) Retrieve the extinction in the r band for photometric objects where their declination is equal to -18.8098484043374 or their cleanliness is 0.
(6) Retrieve the extinction values for objects with a declination of -18.8098484043374 or with a clean status of 0 from the photoobj table.
(7) Retrieve the extinction values for objects in the photometric database where the declination is -18.8098484043374 or the object has been flagged as unclean.
