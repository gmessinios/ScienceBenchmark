Original Query:
SELECT T1.value FROM photo_type AS T1 JOIN neighbors AS T2 ON T1.value = T2.neighbortype WHERE T2.type != 3
GPT-3 choices:
(0) What is the value of photometrically observed objects where the type of the nearest neighbor object is not equal to 3?
(1) Retrieve the photometric values of objects that have been observed and are not classified as type 3, from the table "photo_type" by joining it with the "neighbors" table on their shared value in order to find their nearest neighbors.
(2) What is the value of photometrically observed objects that are not type 3 and also appear as a neighbor in the neighbors table?
(3) Retrieve the photometrically observed values from the "photo_type" table where the type of the nearest neighbor object is not equal to 3.
(4) What is the value of photometrically observed objects that are not type 3 neighbors?
(5) What is the value of photometrically observed objects for the nearest neighbor objects that are not of type 3?
(6) Retrieve the photometrically observed value for all objects that are not of type 3 from the nearest neighbor table, and join it with the photo_type table.
(7) Find the values from the column "value" in the table "photometrically_observed" for objects that have a neighbor type that is not equal to 3.
