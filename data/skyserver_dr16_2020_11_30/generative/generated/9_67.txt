Original Query:
SELECT T1.bestobjid FROM specobj AS T1 JOIN photoobj AS T2 ON T1.bestobjid = T2.objid WHERE T2.clean != 1
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the best object identification number from the spectroscopic objects table for objects that do not have a clean status in the photoobj table.
(1) Retrieve the bestobjid value from Spectroscopic_objects for all objects where their corresponding Photometric_objects do not have a clean value of 1.
(2) Retrieve the best object ID from the spectroscopic objects table for all objects where the corresponding photometric object is not considered clean.
(3) Find the bestobjid for all Spectroscopic_objects that have a matching bestobjid in Photometric_objects, but only if their corresponding clean value is not equal to 1.
(4) Find the best object ID from the spectroscopic objects table for those objects whose clean status is not equal to 1 in the photometric objects table.
(5) Retrieve the bestobjid values from the specobj table where the corresponding objid values in the photoobj table have a clean value of not equal to 1.
(6) "Retrieve the best object ID from the spectroscopic objects table where the clean status in the photometric objects table is not equal to 1."
(7) Find the bestobjid of objects in the Spectroscopic_objects table that have a matching objid in the Photometric_objects table and do not have a clean value of 1.
