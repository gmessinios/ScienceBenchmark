Original Query:
SELECT T1.specobjid FROM spplines AS T1 JOIN specobj AS T2 ON T1.specobjid = T2.specobjid WHERE T2.survey != "segue1"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the specobjid values from the spplines table for all objects in the Spectroscopic_objects table that do not have "segue1" as their survey value.
(1) Retrieve the specobjid values from the spplines table where the survey in the associated row in the specobj table is not equal to "segue1".
(2) Retrieve the specobjid from the spplines table where the survey in the associated Spectroscopic_objects table is not "segue1".
(3) Find the specobjid from the spplines table for spectroscopic objects in the specobj table that do not belong to the "segue1" survey.
(4) Find the specobjid from the spplines table where the corresponding survey in the specobj table is not equal to "segue1".
(5) Find the specobjid values from the spplines table for all spectroscopic objects in the specobj table that are not part of the "segue1" survey.
(6) Get the specobjid from Stellar_spectal_line_indices where the survey in specobj is not "segue1".
(7) Find the specobjid from Stellar_spectal_line_indices where the survey in Spectroscopic_objects is not "segue1".
