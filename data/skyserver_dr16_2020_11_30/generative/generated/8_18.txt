Original Query:
SELECT T1.r FROM photoobj AS T1 WHERE T1.cmodelmag_u != 13.911
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the value of the "r" column from the "photoobj" table where the value in the "cmodelmag_u" column is not equal to 13.911.
(1) Retrieve the values of r from the photometric objects table where the cmodelmag_u column is not equal to 13.91.
(2) Retrieve the value for the "r" column from the table "photoobj" for all objects where the magnitude in the "cmodelmag_u" column is not equal to 13.911.
(3) Find the r magnitude values from the photoobj table for objects with a cmodelmag_u value that is not equal to 13.911.
(4) Retrieve the values in the "r" column from the table "photoobj" where the value in the column "cmodelmag_u" is not equal to 13.911.
(5) What is the r-band magnitude from the photoobj table for objects where the u-band cmodel magnitude is not equal to 13.911?
(6) Get the right ascension (r) of all photometric objects from the photoobj table where the cmodelmag_u column is not equal to 13.911.
(7) Find the r-band magnitude values from the photoobj table for objects with a cmodelmag_u value not equal to 13.911.
