Original Query:
SELECT T1.type FROM neighbors AS T1 JOIN photo_type AS T2 ON T1.neighbortype = T2.value WHERE T2.description != "Galaxy: An extended object composed of many stars and other matter."
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the type of nearest neighbour objects where the photometrically observed description is not "Galaxy: An extended object composed of many stars and other matter."
(1) Retrieve the type of objects from the table "Nearest_neighbour_objects" that are not described as a galaxy in the table "photo_type", where the value in the column "neighbortype" matches with the value in the column "value".
(2) Find the type of nearest neighbor objects that have been photometrically observed and are not described as galaxies.
(3) "Retrieve the type of nearest neighbor objects that have been photometrically observed and are not described as galaxies."
(4) What are the types of nearest neighbor objects that have been photometrically observed and are not described as galaxies?
(5) Retrieve the type of nearest neighbor objects whose description is not "Galaxy: An extended object composed of many stars and other matter.", by joining the neighbors table with the photo_type table and selecting the type from Nearest_neighbour_objects.
(6) Retrieve the type of objects that are nearest neighbours to other objects, excluding galaxies.
(7) Find the types of nearest neighbor objects where their photometrically observed value is not "Galaxy: An extended object composed of many stars and other matter."
