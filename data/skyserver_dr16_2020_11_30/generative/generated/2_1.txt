Original Query:
SELECT T1.neighbormode, count(*) FROM neighbors AS T1  GROUP BY T1.neighbormode
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the number of objects in the neighbors table grouped by their neighbormode, and return the neighbormode and count for each group.
(1) "How many objects have been classified according to their nearest neighbor mode and what is the total count for each type?"
(2) How many neighbors are there for each mode of the nearest neighbor objects in the neighbors table?
(3) Find the number of nearest neighbor objects for each neighbor mode in the neighbors table and group the results by neighbormode.
(4) Count the number of objects and group them by their nearest neighbor mode.
(5) Count the number of objects in the "neighbors" table grouped by their mode of nearest neighbor.
(6) What is the count of neighbors grouped by neighbor mode in the Nearest_neighbour_objects table?
(7) How many objects have a particular neighbor mode, and what is the count for each one?
