GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the specobjid from the specobj table where the subclass is not equal to "L1".
(1) Find the specobjid of all objects in the specobj table where the subclass is not "L1".
(2) Retrieve the specobjid of all objects in the Spectroscopic_objects table where the subclass is not equal to "L1".
(3) Retrieve the spectroscopic object identification numbers from the specobj table for all objects where the subclass is not equal to "L1".
(4) Find the specobjid for all objects in the Spectroscopic_objects table where the subclass is not "L1".
(5) Retrieve the specobjid from the specobj table for objects in which the subclass is not "L1".
(6) Get the specobjid for all spectroscopic objects where their subclass is not "L1".
(7) Find the specobjid of spectroscopic objects that do not have a subclass of "L1".
