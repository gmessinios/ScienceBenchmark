###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.loadversion FROM photoobj AS T1 JOIN photo_type AS T2 ON T1.type = T2.value WHERE T2.value != 2
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Get the load version from the photometric objects table for all objects that have been observed using photometric methods.
(1) Get the load version from the Photometric_objects table for all objects that have been photometrically observed, excluding those with a type value of 2.
(2) Find the load version of photometric objects from the table photoobj where the type is not equal to 2 and is also in the table photo_type.
(3) Find the loadversion values from the photoobj table where the type value is not equal to 2 and is a photometrically observed object.
(4) Find the version of the photometric objects that were observed using photometric methods and are not flagged as type 2.
(5) Get the load version from the photoobj table for all photometrically observed objects that are not type 2, joined with the photo_type table on the type column.
(6) Find the version number of the load for objects in the Photometric_objects table where their type is not equal to 2 as defined in the photo_type table.
(7) Retrieve the loadversion from the photoobj table for all objects that have been observed photometrically, but exclude those with a type value of 2.
