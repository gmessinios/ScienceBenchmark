Original Query:
SELECT T1.neighbormode FROM neighbors AS T1 JOIN photoobj AS T2 ON T1.objid = T2.objid WHERE T2.type != 3
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the mode of the neighbor objects from a table called "neighbors" joined with another table called "photoobj", where the object IDs are equal and the type is not equal to 3 in the latter table.
(1) Find the neighbor mode for the nearest neighbor objects that have a different type from 3 in the table of neighbors, joined with the table of photometric objects based on their shared object ID.
(2) What is the neighbor mode for all nearest neighbour objects that have an object ID in the neighbors table and a type not equal to 3 in the photoobj table?
(3) Retrieve the nearest neighbour mode of each object from the neighbors table, where the object's type is not equal to 3 in the photoobj table.
(4) Find the neighbormode of nearest neighbors from objects with objid in the neighbors table, only including those from photoobj where type is not equal to 3.
(5) Find the mode of nearest neighbour objects from the neighbor table for objects in the photoobj table where their type is not equal to 3.
(6) Retrieve the mode of the neighboring objects from the neighbors table for all Photometric objects that are not of type 3.
(7) Retrieve the neighbor mode from the nearest neighbour objects for all photometric objects where the object type is not equal to 3.
