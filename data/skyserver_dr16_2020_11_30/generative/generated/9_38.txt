GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the load version for spectroscopic objects where the specobjid does not equal 300700239378016256 and is joined with emission line estimates on the specobjid.
(1) Retrieve the load version from the table of spectroscopic objects for any entry in the galactic spectral line table where the object's specobjid is not equal to 300700239378016256.
(2) Retrieve the load version from the Spectroscopic Objects table for all objects where the specobjid in Emission Line Estimates is not equal to 300700239378016256.
(3) Retrieve the load version of all spectroscopic objects where the specobjid does not equal 300700239378016256 from the Spectroscopic_objects and galspecline tables, while joining on the specobjid column in order to also include any associated emission line estimates.
(4) Retrieve the load version from the Spectroscopic_objects table for all objects with matching specobjid in both the specobj and galspecline tables, excluding those with a specobjid of 300700239378016256 in the Emission_line_estimates table.
(5) Find the loadversion from the table Spectroscopic_objects for all objects where the specobjid in galspecline does not equal 300700239378016256.
(6) Find the load version for a spectroscopic object where the specobjid in the emission line estimates table does not equal 300700239378016256.
(7) Retrieve the load version of the spectroscopic objects for each emission line estimate that has a specobjid different from 300700239378016256.
