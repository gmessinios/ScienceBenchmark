GPT-3 choices:
(0) "Retrieve the IDs of nearest neighbour objects that have been photometrically observed as galaxies."
(1) Find the nearest neighbor object IDs of all galaxies that have been photometrically observed.
(2) Find the ID of the nearest neighbor objects where their type is a galaxy and has been photometrically observed.
(3) What is the ID of all objects that are considered nearest neighbors to galaxies based on their photometric observation type?
(4) What are the IDs of the nearest neighbor objects that have been observed photometrically as galaxies?
(5) What is the object ID for the nearest neighbor of a galaxy that has been photometrically observed?
(6) Which nearest neighbor objects have a neighbor type that is classified as "GALAXY" in the photo type table?
(7) Find the neighborobjid of the nearest neighbor objects where their neighbor type is a galaxy that has been observed photometrically.
