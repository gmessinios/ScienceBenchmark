Original Query:
SELECT T1.specobjid FROM spplines AS T1 JOIN specobj AS T2 ON T1.specobjid = T2.specobjid WHERE T2.ra != 0.000881
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the specobjid from the table spplines where the corresponding ra value in the table specobj is not equal to 0.000881.
(1) Get the specobjid from the Stellar_spectal_line_indices table where the corresponding Spectroscopic_objects have an ra value that is not equal to 0.000881.
(2) Retrieve the specobjid from spplines where the ra value in Spectroscopic_objects is not equal to 0.000881 and join with the specobj table to get all corresponding spectroscopic objects.
(3) Find the specobjid values from the table spplines where Spectroscopic_objects has a non-zero value for ra, but exclude the entry with an ra value of 0.000881.
(4) Find the specobjid values from the spplines table where Spectroscopic_objects has a different value for ra other than 0.000881 and join it with the specobj table on the specobjid column to retrieve all corresponding information.
(5) Retrieve the specobjid values from the spplines table for all rows in which the ra column of the Spectroscopic_objects table is not equal to 0.000881.
(6) Retrieve the specobjid from spplines for all Stellar_spectal_line_indices, where the corresponding Spectroscopic_objects have a non-zero ra value.
(7) Retrieve the specobjid values from the Stellar_spectal_line_indices table where the ra value in the Spectroscopic_objects table is not equal to 0.000881.
