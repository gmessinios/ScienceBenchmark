Original Query:
SELECT T1.description FROM photo_type AS T1 JOIN neighbors AS T2 ON T1.value = T2.neighbortype WHERE T2.neighbormode = 2
GPT-3 choices:
(0) What are the descriptions of all photometrically observed objects that are neighbors in the 2nd mode?
(1) "Retrieve the description from photometrically observed photo types for nearest neighbor objects with a mode of 2."
(2) What are the descriptions of photometrically observed objects that are also nearest neighbor objects with a neighbor mode value of 2?
(3) What is the description of all photometrically observed objects that are the nearest neighbor to a certain type of object where the neighbor mode is 2?
(4) What are the descriptions of objects that have been observed photometrically and are the nearest neighbors to a specific object?
(5) What is the description of photometrically observed objects that are nearest neighbors in mode 2, based on their neighbor type?
(6) Retrieve the description of the photometrically observed type for the nearest neighbor objects in which their neighbor mode is equal to 2.
(7) What is the description of the photometrically observed neighbor type for objects that are nearest neighbors in mode 2?
