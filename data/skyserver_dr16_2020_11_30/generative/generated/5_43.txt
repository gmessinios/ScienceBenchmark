Original Query:
SELECT T1.veldisperr FROM specobj AS T1    ORDER BY T1.mjd DESC LIMIT 1
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Get the velocity dispersion error from the most recent spectroscopic object in descending order of modified Julian date.
(1) What is the velocity dispersion error of the latest spectroscopic object?
(2) Retrieve the velocity dispersion error for the most recent spectroscopic object in the specobj table, ordered by modified Julian date and limited to one result.
(3) Get the velocity dispersion error from the most recent spectroscopic object in the specobj table, ordered by modified Julian date and limited to 1 result.
(4) Get the velocity dispersion error from the latest entry in the specobj table for all spectroscopic objects, sorted by date in descending order, with a limit of one.
(5) What is the velocity dispersion error for the most recent spectroscopic object in the specobj table?
(6) "Retrieve the velocity dispersion error from the most recent spectroscopic object in descending order by modified Julian date, with a limit of one."
(7) Find the velocity dispersion error from the most recent spectroscopic object in the table, sorted by modified Julian date, limited to 1.
