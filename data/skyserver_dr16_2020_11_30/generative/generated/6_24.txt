Original Query:
SELECT T1.rowc FROM photoobj AS T1 WHERE T1.cmodelmag_g = 13.73239 and T1.r = 12.37496
GPT-3 choices:
(0) "Retrieve the value of 'rowc' from the table 'photoobj' where the values for 'cmodelmag_g' and 'r' are 13.73239 and 12.37496, respectively."
(1) Retrieve the rowc value from the photoobj table where the cmodelmag_g column is equal to 13.73239 and the r column is equal to 12.37496, and store it in a variable called Photometric_objects.
(2) Find the rowc value for a photometric object with a cmodelmag_g of 13.73239 and r of 12.37496 from the photoobj table.
(3) Find the rowc value from the photoobj table where the cmodelmag_g column is equal to 13.73239 and the r column is equal to 12.37496 for Photometric objects.
(4) Find the row number from the photoobj table where the cmodelmag_g column has a value of 13.73239 and the r column has a value of 12.37496, and return only the rowc column for those rows that match these conditions.
(5) Find the rowc value from the Photometric_objects table where the cmodelmag_g column is equal to 13.73239 and r column is equal to 12.37496 in the photoobj table.
(6) Retrieve the rowc value from Photometric_objects where the cmodelmag_g is 13.73239 and r is 12.37496.
(7) Find the row number for a photometric object with a cmodel magnitude of 13.73239 in the g-band and a r-band magnitude of 12.37496 from the photoobj table.
