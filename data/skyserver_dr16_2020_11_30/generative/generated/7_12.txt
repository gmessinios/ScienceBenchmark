GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the type of nearest neighbor objects where the neighbor mode or mode is equal to 1.
(1) Find the type of objects that are nearest neighbors and have a neighbor mode or mode value of 1.
(2) What is the type of objects that are either in neighbor mode 1 or have a mode value of 1 from the neighbors table?
(3) Retrieve the type of nearest neighbor objects that have a neighbor mode value of 1 or a mode value of 1.
(4) Get the types of nearest neighbor objects where the neighbor mode is either 1 or the mode is also 1.
(5) Get the type of objects from the nearest neighbors where either the neighbormode or mode is equal to 1.
(6) "Retrieve the type of objects belonging to neighboring or mode 1 in the neighbors table."
(7) Retrieve the types of nearest neighbor objects where the neighbormode or mode is equal to 1.
