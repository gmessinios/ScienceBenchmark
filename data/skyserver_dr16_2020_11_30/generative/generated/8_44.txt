###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.extinction_r FROM photoobj AS T1 WHERE T1.cmodelmag_u != 14.14542
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the extinction_r value from the photoobj table for all objects that have a cmodelmag_u value not equal to 14.14542 and refer to this table as Photometric_objects.
(1) Retrieve the extinction value in the r-band for all objects in the Photometric_objects table where their cmodel magnitude in the u-band is not equal to 14.14542.
(2) Retrieve the value for extinction in the r band from the table of photometric objects, where the cmodel magnitude in the u band is not equal to 14.14542.
(3) What is the value of the "extinction_r" column in the "Photometric_objects" table for all objects where the "cmodelmag_u" column is not equal to 14.14542?
(4) Get the extinction_r value from the Photometric_objects table where the cmodelmag_u column is not equal to 14.14542 in the photoobj database.
(5) Retrieve the extinction value for the r band from the photometric objects table where the cmodel magnitude in the u band is not equal to 14.14542.
(6) Retrieve the extinction value in the r-band for objects with a non-null cmodel magnitude in the u-band from the table "photoobj" and alias it as "Photometric_objects".
(7) What is the value of the extinction in the r band for photometric objects with a cmodel magnitude in u-band not equal to 14.14542, from the photoobj table as Photometric_objects?
