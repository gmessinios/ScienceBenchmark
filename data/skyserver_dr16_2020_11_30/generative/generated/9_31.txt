Original Query:
SELECT T1.specobjid FROM galspecline AS T1 JOIN specobj AS T2 ON T1.specobjid = T2.specobjid WHERE T2.loadversion != 1017
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Select the specobjid values from the Emission_line_estimates table where the loadversion column in the joined Spectroscopic_objects table is not equal to 1017.
(1) Find the specobjid values from galspecline where the corresponding specobjid in specobj has a loadversion that is not equal to 1017.
(2) Find the specobjid of all emission line estimates for galaxies that have been spectroscopically observed, excluding those with a loadversion of 1017.
(3) Find the specobjid for each emission line estimate where the loadversion in the specobj table is not equal to 1017.
(4) Find the specobjid from the galspecline table where the loadversion of the corresponding Spectroscopic_objects entry is not equal to 1017.
(5) Retrieve the specobjid from the galspecline table where the corresponding Spectroscopic_objects have a loadversion other than 1017.
(6) Get the specobjid of all objects in galspecline that have a matching specobjid in specobj, but only if the loadversion for that object in specobj is not equal to 1017.
(7) Retrieve the specobjid from the table Emission_line_estimates where the loadversion is not equal to 1017 in the table Spectroscopic_objects.
