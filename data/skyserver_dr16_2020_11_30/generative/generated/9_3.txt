Original Query:
SELECT T1.description FROM photo_type AS T1 JOIN neighbors AS T2 ON T1.value = T2.neighbortype WHERE T2.neighbormode != 1
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the description of photometrically observed objects that are nearest neighbors to objects with a neighbor type different from 1.
(1) Retrieve the description of the photometrically observed object type from the photo_type table where the value matches the neighbor type in the neighbors table and the neighbor mode is not equal to 1.
(2) Find the description of photometrically observed objects whose value matches the neighbor type of the nearest neighbor, but only if the neighbor mode is not equal to 1.
(3) Retrieve the description of all photometrically observed objects that are the nearest neighbors to other objects, but exclude any objects where the neighbor mode is equal to 1.
(4) "Retrieve the description of photometrically observed objects from a table of photo types, joined with a table of nearest neighbor objects where the neighbor type matches the photometrically observed value and the neighbor mode is not equal to 1."
(5) "Find the description for all photometrically observed objects that are listed as nearest neighbors with a neighbor type not equal to 1."
(6) Retrieve the description from photometrically observed objects that have a value equal to the neighbor type in the Nearest_neighbour_objects table, where the neighbor mode is not equal to 1.
(7) What is the description of photometrically observed objects that are neighbors to objects with a neighbor type that is not equal to 1?
