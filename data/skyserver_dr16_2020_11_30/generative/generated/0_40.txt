GPT-3 choices:
(0) "Retrieve the right ascension of all objects from the photoobj table with a cmodel magnitude in the u band equal to 14.22152."
(1) "Retrieve the r magnitude from the photoobj table for Photometric objects where their cmodel u magnitude is 14.22152."
(2) Get the r values from the photoobj table for all photometric objects where their cmodelmag_u is equal to 14.22152.
(3) "Retrieve the r value from the photoobj table for objects with a cmodel magnitude of 14.22152 in the u band."
(4) What is the r-band magnitude of all objects in the photoobj table with a cmodel u-band magnitude of 14.22152?
(5) Retrieve the r magnitude values from the table "Photometric_objects" where the cmodelmag_u is equal to 14.22152.
(6) "Retrieve the value of r from the photoobj table for all objects with a cmodelmag_u value of 14.22152 in the Photometric_objects column."
(7) Retrieve the value of column "r" from the table "photoobj" where the value in column "cmodelmag_u" is equal to 14.22152 and label it as "Photometric_objects".
