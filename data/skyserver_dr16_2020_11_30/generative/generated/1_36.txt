GPT-3 choices:
(0) What is the name of the program for the spectroscopic object with a specobjid of 299621343962359808 that has corresponding emission line estimates in the galspecline table?
(1) Retrieve the program name from the spectroscopic_objects table for a given specobjid where that same specobjid can be found in both the specobj and galspecline tables.
(2) Retrieve the program name from the spectroscopic objects for which there is an emission line estimate with a specobjid of 299621343962359808.
(3) Retrieve the program name of the spectroscopic object where its specobjid matches that of the emission line estimate with a specobjid of 299621343962359808.
(4) Retrieve the program name of the spectroscopic object that has a specobjid of 299621343962359808 in the table specobj, joined with the table galspecline where the specobjid matches and has emission line estimates.
(5) Find the name of the program for a spectroscopic object with a specobjid of 299621343962359808 that has emission line estimates in the galspecline table.
(6) Retrieve the program name of a spectroscopic object from the table of specobj and join it with the emission line estimates on their shared specobjid, for a specific specobjid value.
(7) Retrieve the program name for the spectroscopic object with a specobjid of 299621343962359808 from the tables specobj and galspecline.
