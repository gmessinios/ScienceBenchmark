(2) "Retrieve the neighbor type from the neighbors table for objects where the type is equal to 0 or the neighbor mode is equal to 2."
(3) Get the type of nearest neighbor objects from the "neighbors" table where the type is either 0 or the neighbor mode is equal to 2.
(4) What is the type of nearest neighbor objects that have a type of 0 or a neighbor mode of 2 in the neighbors table?
(5) "Retrieve the neighbor type of the nearest neighbor objects where the type is equal to 0 or the neighbor mode is equal to 2."
(6) Find the type of nearest neighbors that are either of type 0 or have a neighbor mode of 2.
(7) Find the neighbor types of all nearest neighbor objects where the type is equal to 0 or the neighbor mode is equal to 2.
