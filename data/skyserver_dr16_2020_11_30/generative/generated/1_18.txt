Original Query:
SELECT T1.specobjid FROM galspecline AS T1 JOIN specobj AS T2 ON T1.specobjid = T2.specobjid WHERE T2.fiberid = 81
GPT-3 choices:
(0) What is the specobjid for a galaxy's emission line estimates where the fiberid is equal to 81?
(1) Find the specobjid from Emission_line_estimates where Spectroscopic_objects' fiberid is equal to 81, and also join with specobj table.
(2) Retrieve the specobjid value from the galspecline table where the fiberid in the Spectroscopic_objects table is equal to 81.
(3) Retrieve the specobjid from the table Emission_line_estimates where the fiberid is equal to 81, and also join it with the table specobj.
(4) Find the specobjid from the table Emission_line_estimates where the fiberid is equal to 81 and join it with the specobj table on their matching specobjids.
(5) Find the specobjid for the Emission_line_estimates where Spectroscopic_objects.fiberid is equal to 81, and join it with the specobj table using the shared specobjid.
(6) Find the specobjid from the Emission_line_estimates table where the fiberid is equal to 81 and join it with the specobj table on their corresponding specobjids.
(7) What is the specobjid value for the galspecline table where the fiberid in the specobj table is equal to 81?
