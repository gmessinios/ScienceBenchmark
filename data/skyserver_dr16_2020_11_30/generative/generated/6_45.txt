Original Query:
SELECT T1.mjd FROM specobj AS T1 WHERE T1.special_target1 = 6442450944 and T1.subclass = "G8V (101501)"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the MJD values for objects in the "specobj" table where the special_target1 column has a value of 6442450944 and the subclass column has a value of "G8V (101501)".
(1) "Retrieve the mjd values from the specobj table for objects with a special_target1 value of 6442450944 and a subclass of 'G8V (101501)'."
(2) "Retrieve the Modified Julian Date values from the 'mjd' column of the specobj table, for objects with a special_target1 value of 6442450944 and a subclass of "G8V (101501)".
(3) Find the mjd value from the specobj table for spectroscopic objects with a special_target1 of 6442450944 and a subclass of "G8V (101501)".
(4) Find the date (mjd) for spectroscopic objects where the special target1 is 6442450944 and the subclass is "G8V (101501)".
(5) "Select the MJD values from the specobj table for objects with a special target of 6442450944 and a subclass of G8V (101501)."
(6) Find the Modified Julian Date for all objects from the Spectroscopic Catalog where the special target1 is equal to 6442450944 and the subclass is "G8V (101501)".
(7) Get the MJD values from specobj where special_target1 is equal to 6442450944 and subclass is equal to "G8V (101501)".
