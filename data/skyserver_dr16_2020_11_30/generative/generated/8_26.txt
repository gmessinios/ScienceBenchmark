Original Query:
SELECT T1.r FROM photoobj AS T1 WHERE T1.cmodelmag_u != 13.95065
GPT-3 choices:
(0) "Retrieve the values for column 'r' from the table 'photoobj' where the value in column 'cmodelmag_u' is not equal to 13.95065 and label it as 'Photometric_objects'."
(1) "Retrieve the 'r' value from the 'photoobj' table where the CModel magnitude for U band is not equal to 13.95065 for photometric objects."
(2) Retrieve the r magnitude from the photoobj table for all objects with a cmodelmag_u value that is not equal to 13.95065 in the Photometric_objects collection.
(3) "Retrieve the r magnitude from the photoobj table for all photometric objects where the cmodelmag_u value is not equal to 13.95065."
(4) Retrieve the value in the "r" column of the "photoobj" table for all rows where the value in the "cmodelmag_u" column is not equal to 13.95065, from a table named "Photometric_objects".
(5) Find the r value for all objects in the photoobj table where their cmodelmag_u value is not equal to 13.95065.
(6) "Retrieve the values in the 'r' column from the table 'photoobj' where the value in the 'cmodelmag_u' column is not equal to 13.95065 and label this data as Photometric_objects."
(7) Retrieve the "r" values from the table "photoobj" for objects in the "Photometric_objects" category that have a value for "cmodelmag_u" that is not equal to 13.95065.
