Original Query:
SELECT T1.objid, count(*) FROM neighbors AS T1  GROUP BY T1.objid
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the number of objects and their IDs from the table of neighbors grouped by the nearest neighbor object's ID.
(1) Find the object IDs and the number of their nearest neighbors from a table called "neighbors" and group them by each individual object ID.
(2) Count the number of objects and their respective object IDs for the nearest neighboring objects in a table called "neighbors" grouped by each object's ID.
(3) Get the count of objects that are nearest neighbours for each object, grouped by object ID.
(4) "Count the number of objects and their respective IDs from the neighbors table grouped by the object ID in ascending order."
(5) Count the number of objects in each nearest neighbor group and display the object IDs for those groups.
(6) Find the number of neighbors for each object in the "neighbors" table and group them by their corresponding objid.
(7) "Count the number of objects and their associated object IDs from the table of nearest neighbor objects, grouping them by object ID."
