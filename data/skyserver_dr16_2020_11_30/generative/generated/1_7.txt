Original Query:
SELECT T1.specobjid FROM spplines AS T1 JOIN specobj AS T2 ON T1.specobjid = T2.specobjid WHERE T2.z = -0.001668776
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the specobjid for all spplines where the z value in the corresponding entry in specobj is equal to -0.001668776.
(1) Find the specobjid from spplines where the corresponding Spectroscopic_objects have a redshift value of -0.001668776.
(2) Find the specobjid from the spplines table where the redshift value in the corresponding row in the specobj table is equal to -0.001668776.
(3) Get the specobjid from spplines where the corresponding Spectroscopic_objects have a redshift value of -0.001668776.
(4) Find the specobjid for stellar spectral line indices where the redshift value in Spectroscopic objects is -0.001668776.
(5) Find the specobjid for all spplines where the corresponding Spectroscopic_objects have a redshift of -0.001668776.
(6) Retrieve the specobjid from spplines where the corresponding z value in the specobj table is -0.001668776.
(7) Retrieve the specobjid from spplines where the corresponding spectroscopic object has a redshift of -0.001668776.
