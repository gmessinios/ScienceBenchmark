(1) How many neighbors have a neighbor mode of 1 in the table "neighbors"?
(2) How many nearest neighbor objects are there in the table "neighbors" with a neighbormode value of 1?
(3) How many neighbors have the neighbor mode set to 1 in the "neighbors" table?
(4) How many objects are in the "neighbors" table that have a value of 1 for the "neighbormode" column?
(5) How many objects are in the neighbors table with a neighbormode of 1?
(6) "How many objects are in the 'neighbors' table where the 'neighbormode' column has a value of 1?"
(7) Count the number of objects in the table "neighbors" where the "neighbormode" column has a value of 1.
