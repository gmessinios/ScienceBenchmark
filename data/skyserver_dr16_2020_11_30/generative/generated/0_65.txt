###


Original Query:
SELECT T1.objid FROM neighbors AS T1 WHERE T1.neighbortype = 6
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the object IDs of the nearest neighbor objects from the neighbors table where their neighbor type is equal to 6.
(1) Find the object IDs of the nearest neighbor objects from a table called "neighbors" where the neighbor type is 6.
(2) Find the object IDs of the nearest neighbour objects whose neighbortype is 6 from the table called "neighbors".
(3) Find the object IDs of the nearest neighbors whose neighbor type is 6 from the table "neighbors" and return them from the table "Nearest_neighbour_objects".
(4) Find the object IDs of the nearest neighbors that have a neighbor type of 6 in the table named "neighbors".
(5) "Retrieve the object IDs for all nearest neighbors that have a neighbor type of 6 from the table 'neighbors'."
(6) Get the object IDs of the nearest neighbor objects from the "neighbors" table where the neighbor type is equal to 6.
(7) Find the IDs of objects that are nearest neighbours with a neighbour type of 6 in the "neighbors" table.
