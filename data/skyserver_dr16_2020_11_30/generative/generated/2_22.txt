Original Query:
SELECT T1.cmodelmag_g, count(*) FROM photoobj AS T1  GROUP BY T1.cmodelmag_g
GPT-3 choices:
(0) How many photometric objects are there and what is their CModel magnitude in the G band?
(1) What is the count of all objects grouped by their g-band cmodel magnitudes in the Photometric_objects table from the photoobj database?
(2) How many Photometric objects have a cmodel magnitude in the g-band, and what is the total count for each unique value?
(3) Count the number of objects and their cmodelmag_g values from the photoobj table, grouping them by their cmodelmag_g value and selecting only the count and cmodelmag_g columns from the Photometric_objects table.
(4) "Find the count of objects in the photoobj table grouped by their cmodelmag_g value from the Photometric_objects table."
(5) How many photometric objects are there and what is the g-band cmodel magnitude of each one?
(6) Retrieve the count of objects in the photoobj table grouped by their g-band cmodel magnitude, and also include their corresponding cmodelmag_g values.
(7) "Count the number of photometric objects and their corresponding cmodelmag_g values from the photoobj table, grouping them by their cmodelmag_g values."
