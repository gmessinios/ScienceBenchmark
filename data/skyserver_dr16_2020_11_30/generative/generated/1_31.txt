Original Query:
SELECT T1.specobjid FROM galspecline AS T1 JOIN specobj AS T2 ON T1.specobjid = T2.specobjid WHERE T2.survey = "boss"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the specobjid values from the galspecline table where the survey in the corresponding row of the specobj table is "boss".
(1) Find the spectral object ID for emission line estimates where the survey is "boss".
(2) Find the specobjid for all galspeclines from Emission_line_estimates where the survey is "boss" in the Spectroscopic_objects table.
(3) Retrieve the specobjid values from the galspecline table where the survey is "boss" in the specobj table.
(4) Retrieve the specobjid values from the Emission_line_estimates table for all objects in the Spectroscopic_objects table that belong to the "boss" survey.
(5) Find the specobjid for all objects in the galspecline table that are associated with a survey called "boss" in the specobj table.
(6) Find the specobjid from the galspecline table where the survey in the corresponding row of specobj is "boss".
(7) Retrieve the specobjid from the Emission_line_estimates table for all spectroscopic objects with a survey value of "boss" in the Spectroscopic_objects table.
