Original Query:
SELECT T1.dec FROM photoobj AS T1 JOIN photo_type AS T2 ON T1.type = T2.value WHERE T2.name = "COSMIC_RAY"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the declination values for all objects in the photoobj table that have a type value of "COSMIC_RAY", where "COSMIC_RAY" is defined in the photo_type table.
(1) Find the declination of all photometric objects that have been observed as cosmic rays in the photoobj and photo_type tables.
(2) Find the declination values of all objects in the photoobj table that have a type value of "COSMIC_RAY" as defined in the photometrically_observed table.
(3) Retrieve the declination values for all photometric objects from the photoobj table, where the type of object is identified as "COSMIC_RAY" in the photo_type table.
(4) "Retrieve the declination values for all photometric objects that have been observed as cosmic rays in the photoobj table, based on their corresponding type value from the photo_type table."
(5) Get the declination values for all objects from the photoobj table where the type of object is marked as "COSMIC_RAY" in the photo_type table.
(6) Retrieve the declination values of all objects that have been observed as cosmic rays in the photoobj table, joined with the corresponding name value from the photo_type table.
(7) Find the declination values for all photometric objects in the photoobj table that have a type value of "COSMIC_RAY" as specified by the photometrically_observed table.
