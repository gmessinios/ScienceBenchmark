Original Query:
SELECT T1.name FROM photo_type AS T1 JOIN neighbors AS T2 ON T1.value = T2.neighbortype WHERE T2.neighbortype != 6
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the names of objects that have been observed photometrically and are not of type 6, according to their nearest neighbors.
(1) Find the names of all objects that have a neighbor type different from 6 in the table "photo_type".
(2) What are the names of all photometrically observed objects that have a nearest neighbor type that is not equal to 6?
(3) Retrieve the names of objects that have been photometrically observed and are not type 6 according to the table of neighboring objects.
(4) What are the names of all photometrically observed objects that have a nearest neighbor object type other than 6?
(5) Find the names of all photometrically observed objects that have a neighbor type that is not equal to 6.
(6) What is the name of all objects that have been photometrically observed and are not classified as nearest neighbor type 6?
(7) Retrieve the names of all photometrically observed objects that are not type 6, according to the list of nearest neighbor objects.
