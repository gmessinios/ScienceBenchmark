Original Query:
SELECT T1.specobjid FROM galspecline AS T1 JOIN specobj AS T2 ON T1.specobjid = T2.specobjid WHERE T2.veldisperr != 16.29792
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the specobjid from the Emission_line_estimates table where the veldisperr value in the corresponding row of the Spectroscopic_objects table is not equal to 16.29792.
(1) Find the specobjid from the Emission_line_estimates table where the corresponding row in the specobj table has a veldisperr value different from 16.29792.
(2) Select the specobjid from Emission_line_estimates where the veldisperr is not equal to 16.29792 and join it with the specobj table on specobjid to retrieve the same information.
(3) Find the specobjid from the Emission_line_estimates table for all objects in the Spectroscopic_objects table where the veldisperr value is not equal to 16.29792.
(4) "Retrieve the specobjid from the Emission_line_estimates table where the veldisperr value is not equal to 16.29792 and also exists in the Spectroscopic_objects table."
(5) Find the spectral object ID for emission line estimates where the velocity dispersion error is not equal to 16.29792, and join it with the spectroscopic object table using their shared specobjid column.
(6) Find the spectral object IDs from the galspecline table where the veldisperr value in the corresponding row of the specobj table is not equal to 16.29792.
(7) Retrieve the specobjid from the Emission_line_estimates table where the veldisperr value is not equal to 16.29792, after joining with the specobj table on matching specobjid values.
