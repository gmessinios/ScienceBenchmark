Original Query:
SELECT T1.value FROM photo_type AS T1 JOIN photoobj AS T2 ON T1.value = T2.type WHERE T2.i = 12.27805
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the value of the "photometrically observed" field for a photo object with an "i" value of 12.27805 from the "photo_type" table and match it with the corresponding type in the "photoobj" table.
(1) Retrieve the value of photometrically observed types for photo objects where the i value is 12.27805.
(2) Retrieve the value of photometrically observed objects for photo objects with a magnitude of 12.27805 in the i filter.
(3) What is the value of photometrically observed objects in the i-band that have a type matching the value in Photometric objects?
(4) Find the value of photometrically observed objects where the type matches with photoobj objects having a value of 12.27805 for the i parameter.
(5) Retrieve the value of the "photometrically_observed" column from the "photo_type" table for all objects in the "photoobj" table with a type equal to 12.27805 in the "i" column.
(6) Retrieve the value from the "photometrically_observed" column where the type in the "photoobj" table is equal to 12.27805 and join it with the "photo_type" table.
(7) Get the value of "photometrically_observed" for objects with a type that matches the "i" value of 12.27805 in the "photoobj" table.
