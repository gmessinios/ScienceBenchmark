Original Query:
SELECT T1.plateid FROM specobj AS T1    ORDER BY T1.ra DESC LIMIT 1
GPT-3 choices:
(0) What is the plateid for the most recent spectroscopic object, ordered by right ascension?
(1) What is the highest plate ID for all objects in the spectroscopic data ordered by right ascension in descending order?
(2) What is the plate ID of the spectroscopic object with the highest right ascension?
(3) "Retrieve the plate ID from the specobj table, sorting by right ascension in descending order and limiting the result to 1."
(4) Retrieve the plate ID of the spectroscopic object with the highest right ascension, sorted in descending order, limited to one result.
(5) What is the plateid for the object with the highest right ascension in the specobj table?
(6) What is the plate ID for the spectroscopic object with the highest right ascension?
(7) What is the plate ID of the spectroscopic object with the highest right ascension, when selecting from a table called "specobj" and ordering by right ascension in descending order, limited to one result?
