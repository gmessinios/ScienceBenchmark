SELECT T1.specobjid FROM specobj AS T1 JOIN photoobj AS T2 ON T1.bestobjid = T2.objid WHERE T2.objid != 1237645943978983547
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the Spectroscopic_objects' specobjid for all objects where their bestobjid is not equal to 1237645943978983547 in the Photometric_objects table.
(1) Find the specobjid values from the Spectroscopic_objects table where the bestobjid in that table is equal to objid in the Photometric_objects table, but only if objid is not equal to 1237645943978983547.
(2) Find the specobjid for all Spectroscopic_objects that have a different objid than 1237645943978983547 in the photoobj table.
(3) Retrieve the specobjid from Spectroscopic_objects where the bestobjid matches between Spectroscopic_objects and Photometric_objects, and exclude any results where the objid in Photometric_objects is equal to 1237645943978983547.
(4) Retrieve the specobjid of all Spectroscopic_objects where the bestobjid does not equal 1237645943978983547 in the photoobj table.
(5) Retrieve the Spectroscopic object ID from the specobj table where the bestobjid does not equal 1237645943978983547 in the photoobj table.
(6) Find the specobjid of all spectroscopic objects where the bestobjid is not equal to 1237645943978983547 in the specobj table, which is joined with the photoobj table on the condition that Photometric_objects.objid is equal to Spectroscopic_objects.bestobjid.
(7) Find the specobjid of Spectroscopic_objects where Photometric_objects and Spectroscopic_objects have a matching bestobjid, but exclude the row where the objid is 1237645943978983547.
