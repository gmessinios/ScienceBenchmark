Original Query:
SELECT T1.neighborobjid FROM neighbors AS T1 JOIN photoobj AS T2 ON T1.objid = T2.objid WHERE T2.clean != 0
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the IDs of all nearest neighbor objects that are associated with a clean photometric object.
(1) Find the ID of all neighboring objects that have been marked as clean in the "photoobj" table, and return their corresponding object IDs from the "neighbors" table.
(2) Find the IDs of the objects that are nearest neighbors to an object, where the object's photometric data is considered clean.
(3) Find the IDs of objects that are neighbors of clean Photometric objects in the table "Nearest_neighbour_objects".
(4) Find the IDs of objects that are neighbors to other objects and also have a non-zero clean value in the photoobj table.
(5) Find the object IDs of the nearest neighbor objects for each photo object, where the photo object has a clean value not equal to 0.
(6) Find the ID of the nearest neighbor objects from the table "neighbors" that correspond to clean photometric objects from the table "photoobj".
(7) Find the objid values for the nearest neighbor objects from the "neighbors" table that correspond to clean photometric objects in the "photoobj" table.
