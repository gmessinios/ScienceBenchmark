Original Query:
SELECT T1.b FROM photoobj AS T1 JOIN photo_type AS T2 ON T1.type = T2.value WHERE T2.name = "UNKNOWN"
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Find the value for b from the photoobj table for all objects that have a type equal to "UNKNOWN" in the photo_type table.
(1) Find the b values from the Photometric_objects table for objects that have a type value of "UNKNOWN" in the photo_type table.
(2) Find the b value for all photometric objects that have an unknown photo type.
(3) Find the value of "b" from the table "photoobj" where the type is listed as "UNKNOWN" in the table "photometric_objects".
(4) Get the "b" column from the "photoobj" table where the type matches a value in the "photometrically_observed" table and that value's name is equal to "UNKNOWN".
(5) Find the "b" column from the table of photometric objects where the type is equal to "UNKNOWN", joining with the photo_type table where the value matches a record with a name of "UNKNOWN".
(6) "Retrieve the value for column 'b' from the table 'photoobj' where the type is equal to 'UNKNOWN' in the 'photo_type' table."
(7) What is the value for column "b" from the table "photoobj" where the type matches a value in column "value" from table "photo_type", specifically when the name in column "name" from table "photometrically_observed" is equal to "UNKNOWN"?
